         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE uſefulneſs of all divine Truth revealed in the holy Scriptures, with the great Importance of what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerns thoſe <hi>Foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tranſactions</hi> which are the Subject of the enſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> will not leave me without <hi>Apology</hi> for an <hi>Eſſay</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Diſcovery of the mind of God in them.</p>
            <p>As for that part of the Diſcourſe (which is moſt controverſal) concerning the <hi>Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:64928:3"/> have been the farther engaged in it, upon occaſion of Mr. <hi>Whiſton's Treatiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Baptiſm,</hi> eſpecially his laſt, entitled <hi>Infant Baptiſm plainly proved:</hi> For, obſerving the main Hinge of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie about the <hi>right Subjects of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> to turn upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. I concluded the only way to clear this great Point, muſt be to make a diligent ſearch after that Account, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives us of the <hi>Nature and Ends</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant there recorded: And tho' I have declined the handling theſe things in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical way, and therefore have not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to return a particular Anſwer to every thing that hath been aſſerted in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to my Sentiments; Yet, I hope, the judicious Reader may obſerve ſuch a Regard had to what hath been urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Principles which I proceed upon, as will excuſe me from the Charge
<pb facs="tcp:64928:3"/> of <hi>crudely re-aſſerting</hi> thoſe things that have been already anſwered or refuted, without giving any <hi>new Inforcement</hi> to them, or endeavouring to remove the Ground and Occaſion of thoſe Miſtakes which I ſuppoſe in others.</p>
            <p>To the holy Scriptures I refer my ſelf for the Tryal of what is written, and do ſincerely deſire that nothing may paſs for Truth, but upon their Teſtimony; And if I ſometimes walk in an untroden Path, it is not from any Affectation of Novelty, but in purſuance of that Light which they afford me; And, poſſibly, ſeeing thoſe things which at firſt may ſeem <hi>New,</hi> are for the moſt part deduced from a <hi>plain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of Matters of Fact,</hi> they may, upon ſecond Thoughts, gain an aſſent to their Truth ſooner than Opinions ariſing from more nice Speculation.</p>
            <p>That Notion (which is often ſuppoſed
<pb facs="tcp:64928:4"/> in this Diſcrourſe) <hi>That the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and the New do differ in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not in the manner of their Adminiſtration only,</hi> doth indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a more large and particular handling, to free it from thoſe Prejudices and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that have been caſt upon it by many worthy Perſons, who are otherwiſe minded; And accordingly I deſigned to have given a farther account of it in a Diſcourſe of the Covenant made with <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and the State of the Church under the Law. But when I had finiſhed this, and provided ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials alſo for what was to follow, I found my Labour for the clearing and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting of that Point, happily prevented, by the coming forth of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s 3d <hi>Vol. upon the Hebrews,</hi> where it is largely diſcourſed, and the Objections that ſeem to lie againſt it, fully anſwered (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:64928:4"/> in the <hi>Expoſition of the</hi> 8th <hi>Chapter)</hi> whither I now refer my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Satisfaction about it, which he will there find anſwerable to what might be expected from ſo great and learned a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>That the Publication of this little Tract, hath been ſo long delayed, was partly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by thoſe Perplexities which the reſtleſs Plots of the Papiſts, and their bold Attempts to overwhelm us with the worſt of Miſeries, have cauſed, which I thought would ſcarſely give leiſure for the Conſideration of was might be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this kind; and partly by my own Averſion from any thing that looks like the moving of any Controverſie with thoſe that love the Lord Jeſus, and ſincerely eſpouſe the Protestant Intereſt, tho' dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in Principle and Practiſe from me in ſome controverted Point; there being
<pb facs="tcp:64928:5"/> nothing that my Soul more longs for on Earth, than to ſee an intire and hearty <hi>Union</hi> of all that fear God, and <hi>hold the Head,</hi> however differing in their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents about ſome things of <hi>leſſer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and together with theſe things a ſence of Inſufficiency to perform my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with that Advantage to Truth as is to be deſired, had its ſhare: Howbeit, after I had weighed all Circumſtances, the Satisfaction I have, that no Man is by me provoked by any undecent Reflections, or any Occaſion given to uncharitable and unchriſtian Contention; with the Hope that what is here offered, may inform ſome, and give others Occaſion of more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Thoughts in a farther Diſquiſition of the Truths pointed at, prevailed with me at length to caſt in this my Mite into the Publick Treaſury.</p>
            <p>This only I ſhall add, That in the
<pb facs="tcp:64928:5"/> whole, my Aim hath been <hi>to ſpeak the Truth in Love;</hi> and to take my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Scriptures, not grafting any preconcieved Opinions of my own up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Where the Evidence of Truth appears, let it not be refuſed, becauſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in a mean Dreſs, and preſented under the diſadvantage of a rude and unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſtile; But conſider rather the reaſon of what is ſaid; and, with the noble <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> ſearch the Scriptures, to ſee whether theſe things be ſo or not; and the Lord give you Underſtanding in all things.</p>

Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Intereſt compleated by Reſtipulation. No Covenant of mutual benefits betwixt God and Men. §. 2. The general notion of a Covenant as propoſed by God. This further explained, with ſome neceſſary Conſequences of it, in ſeven particulars. §. 3. God hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64928:7"/> always dealt with men about their future ſtate in a way of Covenant. Some Conſectaries of it. §. 4.

               <p>That a Covenant is to be conſidered, either ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as propoſed by God, or as Man enters therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by Reſtipulation. For,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64928:8"/>1. Whatſoever is tranſacted in a foederal way betwixt God and Men, God hath the firſt hand in it. As Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, that they had not choſen him, but he had choſen them; ſo may we ſay, Man hath not at any time entred into Covenant with God, but God hath entred into Covenant with Man; ſeeing it only belongs to his Soveraign Majeſty, and is the fruit of his infinite Goodneſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as of his Wiſdom to chooſe and order the Terms of a <hi>Covenant-relation</hi> between himſelf and his Creatures; And therefore the Covenant that he hath made with Men, is frequently in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaid to be the Lord's Covenant, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4, 6. and other places. Howbeit,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Covenant-relation to God, and Intereſt in him, doth not immediately reſult from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of a Covenant, and Terms of Covenant-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Man; but it is by <hi>Reſtipulation</hi> that he actually enters into Covenant with God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an intereſſed Party in the Covenant; it is a mutual Conſent of the parties in Covenant, that ſtates, and compleats a Covenant-Relation; and this is called <hi>an avouching of the Lord to be their God;</hi> by conſent to the Terms of a Covenant propoſed to them <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 16, 17, 18. <hi>a ſubſcribing with the hand unto the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 44. 5. and <hi>taking hold of his Covenant,</hi> Chap. 56. 4, 6. The formal notion of a <hi>Covenant entred</hi> or <hi>made,</hi> includes <hi>Mutual Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But yet,</p>
               <p n="3">3. There can be no Covenant of <hi>mutual benefits</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64928:9"/> betwixt God and Men, as there may be betwixt one man and another; for all Creatures do neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily depend upon, and have both their Being and Wel-Being from the Bounty of their Creator; there is nothing that they have not received from him, and therefore the moſt perfect of them can render nothing to him, but what is due by the Law of their Creation. None can be profitable to God, tho' he that is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, may be ſo both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <note place="margin">Job 35. 7, 8. Rom. 11. 35, 36.</note> and his Neighbour; and therefore none can oblige God, or make him their Debtor, unleſs he condeſcend to oblige himſelf by Covenant or Promiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The general notion of any Covenant of God with Men, conſidered on the part of God, or as propoſed by him, may be thus conceived of, That it is,</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And for the better underſtanding of what I intend by this <hi>general Deſcription,</hi> I ſhall briefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome <hi>particulars,</hi> that are either included in it, or are the immediate and neceſſary conſequents of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64928:9"/>1. It implies a free and Soveraign Act of the Divine Will, exerted in condeſcending Love and Goodneſs; it is not from any neceſſity of Nature, that God enters into Covenant with Men, but of his own good Pleaſure. Such a priviledg, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, as is included in Covenant-Intereſt, cannot immediately reſult from the relation which they have to God as Creatures, no not as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures, tho' upright, and in a perfect ſtate; for the Lord owes not unto Man the Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in any Covenant he makes with him, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently; but his firſt Right therein, is freely given him by the promiſe of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The notion of a <hi>Covenant</hi> adds <hi>aſſurance</hi> to that of a <hi>promiſe,</hi> as it implies <hi>a ſpecial Bond of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and friendſhip,</hi> which belongs unto Foederal-Intereſt and Relation; for a Covenant is the foundation of a ſpecial Relation betwixt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned therein; the <hi>kind</hi> and benefit of <hi>which Relation</hi> is determined by the Covenant it ſelf, the Nature, Promiſes, and End thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The immediate and direct End therefore, of God's entring into Covenant with Man at any time (ſo far as concerns Man himſelf) is <hi>the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing and bettering of his State;</hi> God did never make a Covenant with Man, wherein his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him was not abundantly manifeſt; yea ſuch is his infinite Bounty, that he hath propoſed no lower End to his Covenant-Tranſactions with Men, then the bringing of them into a bleſſed State in the eternal Fruition of himſelf; And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64928:10"/> therefore, when one Covenant (thro' the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Man in his lapſed State) hath been found weak, and unprofitable, as to this great End of a Covenant, becauſe inſufficient to accompliſh it; God finds fault, aboliſheth it, and introduceth another, wherein full proviſion is made for the perfect Salvation of thoſe that have intereſt in it: <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The kindneſs, and condeſcending Love of God in entring into Covenant with Man, doth ſtrengthen that Bond of Love and Obedience to God, that he is under by the Law of his Creation, by adding a new Obligation thereunto; And therefore the Sin of Man in breaking Covenant with God riſes higher, and is accompanied with greater aggravations, than the bare Tranſgreſſion of a Law, if no ſuch Covenant-relation had been added thereunto. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Revelation of the Counſel of God's Will in a Covenant propoſed to Man, is ſo far from excluding a Reſtipulation on his part, as that it renders it a neceſſary duty upon him. It is not in this caſe as in Foederal Tranſactions betwixt Equals, where one is at liberty to refuſe the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant offered by the other Party; but the ſence of our infinite diſtance from God as Creatures, and the dependence we neceſſarily have upon him, and the duty we owe to him by the unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Law of our Creation, (as well as our own advantage and profit thereby) obligeth us with holy fear, and thankfulneſs, to accept both the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64928:10"/> Benefits he offers to us, and the Terms on which they are offered, in his Covenant; and diligently to perform what we are by him commanded, and directed to, for the Ends propoſed therein. But yet,</p>
               <p n="6">6. This Reſtipulation (and conſequently, the <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of obtaining, as alſo the <hi>right</hi> in which we claim Covenant-Bleſſings) muſt of neceſſity <hi>vary,</hi> according to the different Nature and Terms of thoſe Covenants that God at any time makes with Men: if the Covenant be <hi>of Works,</hi> the Reſtipulation muſt be, by <hi>doing</hi> the things required in it, even by fulfilling its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in <hi>a perfect obedience to the Law of it;</hi> and ſuitable hereunto, the reward is <hi>of Debt</hi> (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it not of Debt abſolutely, but of <hi>Debt by compact)</hi> according the Terms of ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. But if it be a Covenant of free and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Grace, the Reſtipulation required, is <hi>an humble receiving,</hi> or <hi>hearty believing</hi> of thoſe gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Promiſes on which the Covenant is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and accordingly the <hi>Reward</hi> or Covenant Bleſſing, is, immediately, and eminently of <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Therefore <hi>the Good</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that God makes with Men, whether it be conſidered abſolutely, or in compariſon with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Covenant, is chiefly to be meaſured by the Promiſes and Terms thereof; if one Covenant be eſtabliſhed upon <hi>better Promiſes (i. e.</hi> either promiſing a more excellent Good, or in a more excellent Way) then another, it is from thence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64928:11"/> denominated, and for that reaſon to be eſteemed, a <hi>better Covenant</hi> then the other. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And together with theſe things, it may not be unſeaſonable in this place, farther to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>That the holy and wiſe God hath always dealt with the Children of Men in <hi>a way of Covenant;</hi> the Diſplay of infinite Goodneſs hath always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the diſcovery of his infinite Glory in his dealing with Men; and therefore he hath not acted towards them, to the utmoſt Right of his Soveraignty and Dominion over them; had he ſo done, there had never been any <hi>reward of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Bleſſedneſs</hi> aſſigned, and made Due to their Obedience, as by Covenant there hath been; nor had they been brought into any nearer Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, then that which did reſult from their Creation by him: But the great God hath not ſo kept his diſtance from Man, but that he hath condeſcended to <hi>come to Terms</hi> with him; and as he hath required Obedience in ſome things beyond the immediate dictates of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by <hi>poſitive Inſtitutions;</hi> ſo he hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo to oblige himſelf, beyond the Debt of a Creator, by promiſe of a bountiful Reward. And hence it follows;</p>
               <p>That as all the Worſhip and Obedience that God hath required of, and accepted from the Children of Men, hath been upon <hi>Covenant-Terms;</hi> ſo their Ability, or moral capacity, of walking in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64928:11"/> well-pleaſing before him, hath been alſo given to them, or wrought in them, purſuant to the ends of their Covenant-Relation; and therefore muſt be the inſeparable Adjunct (not of the <hi>bare propoſal</hi> of a Covenant to them, but) of that Covenant-Intereſt in which they have been ſtated. And of this, the conſequence is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That perſons once fallen under the guilt of <hi>breach of Covenant,</hi> are by their own default <hi>utterly diſabled</hi> from yielding any acceptable Obedience to God upon the Terms of that Covenant, which they have violated; and in the Intereſt of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-relation which is forfeited and loſt by them; they remain under the paenal Sanction of the Covenant, but are utterly diſpoyled of Strength to anſwer the Ends of that Covenant, and have wholly loſt their Right in the Reward of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they be <hi>without Strength,</hi> with reſpect to the Condition and end of that Covenant, which once they had Intereſt in, and <hi>Principles ſuited to;</hi> then are they ſo <hi>much more,</hi> while they remain in their lapſed ſtate, with reſpect unto the terms of <hi>another Covenant</hi> more excellent and myſterious, and wholly <hi>ſupernatural</hi> as to the Doctrine and Terms thereof. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Spiritual Strength, and Ability to pleaſe God, can no way be reſtored to them, but by <hi>a new Covenant-intereſt,</hi> and that <hi>new Creation</hi> which is the adjunct thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 5. This alſo is worthy to be noted by us,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64928:12"/> That thoſe Covenants which God hath made, wherein either Mankind in general, or ſome ſelect number of Men in particular have been concerned, it hath pleaſed him firſt to tranſact with ſome <hi>publick Perſon, Head,</hi> or <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> for all others that ſhould be concerned in them: Thus it was in the <hi>Covenant of Creation,</hi> which God made with <hi>Adam</hi> in his upright State, and with all Mankind in him; and the ſame is to be obſerved in the <hi>Noachical Covenant;</hi> as alſo in the Covenants made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> conſidered either as the Father of Believers, or of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the intereſt of a ſpiritual Relation to him, Believers claim the Bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace that was made with him; and in the intereſt of a natural Relation to him, his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring according to the fleſh did claim the Rights and Priviledges of that Covenant of Peculiarity which was firſt made with him as the Head of that ſeparate People; but more eminently, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt as the Head thereof; all its Promiſes were firſt given to him; and in him they are all <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen:</hi> It is by Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him that Believers obtain a new-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-intereſt, and from him they derive a <hi>new Life,</hi> Grace, and Strength, to anſwer the Ends of the New-Covenant.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Now as it is evident from what hath been already ſaid, that all <hi>foederal tranſactions</hi> of God with Men flow only form his <hi>good pleaſure,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:64928:12"/> and the <hi>counſel of his Will;</hi> ſo upon that ground it is certainly to be concluded, that our Knowledg and Underſtanding of them, muſt wholly depend upon <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> none can pretend acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the <hi>Secret of God,</hi> but as he hath pleaſed to <hi>reveal</hi> it in his Word; this Light muſt guide all our Inquiries after it; and our ſentiments of things of this nature muſt be ſtrictly governed by <hi>this Rule;</hi> ſeeing the nature of them is ſuch as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends the common Principles of Reaſon or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light, inaſmuch as they owe their original to the <hi>free acts</hi> of the divine Will and Wiſdom, which are unaccountable till revealed by God himſelf; and therefore it becomes us to captivate all our thoughts of them, to the obedience of Faith, as knowing that <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Strength of parts</hi> (tho' of excellent uſe in their place) not guided by <hi>Scripture-light</hi> in theſe Inquiries, can only form an <hi>ingenious error,</hi> and loſe a Man in the Labyrinth of his own Imagination, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gueſſes; ſeeing the ſingle advantage of thoſe aſſiſtances (in this caſe truſted to, and ſtretched beyond their line) can reach no further than to enable him <hi>cum ratione errare;</hi> and ſo to wander from Truth, in a Path ſeeming more ſmooth, tho' no leſs dangerous, than others light upon.</p>
               <p>And therefore in theſe things lies the Spring of <hi>moſt Miſtakes,</hi> and corruption of Doctrine and Practice in matters of Religion; Men do eaſily find out, and agree in the true dictates of the Law of Nature, but in things pertaining to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64928:13"/> Covenants of God, how various are their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! Yea many great, learned, and <hi>good Men</hi> have been divided in their Judgments about ſome things of great importance to the Faith and Edification of the Church, tho' not abſolutely neceſſary to <hi>her Being;</hi> and <hi>ſome one error</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about the nature of God's foederal tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Men, doth ſtrangely perplex the whole Syſteme, or Body of Divinity, and intangle our interpretation of innumerable Texts of Scripture; and by this means Jars and Contentions have been perpetuated in the Church, to the great grief and hindrance of all, the offence of the weak, and greater ſcandal of the blind World; and all this hath been much occaſioned thro' the want of a due and humble attention to that Revelation of Truth which God hath given us in the holy Scriptures, and indeavouring to collect the mind of God from thence without <hi>prepoſſeſſion of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (which is a greater occaſion of theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes then Men are generally aware of) and a careful avoiding the <hi>undue mixture</hi> or confuſion of things <hi>natural,</hi> with thoſe that are purely of a <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral</hi> nature.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch then as <hi>the Covenant</hi> of God is his <hi>Secret,</hi> and he only can <hi>make us to know it;</hi> and yet our Faith and Practice, Comfort, and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is nearly concerned in a good acquaintance with it, we need no other Motive to a diligent and humble ſearch of the Scriptures, for the right informing of our Judgment thereabout; nor no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64928:13"/> other Caution not to attribue overmuch to our own Wiſdom or Abilities, but to manage all our Inquiries with <hi>earneſt prayer</hi> to God for that holy <hi>ſpirit of Light and Truth,</hi> who only can lead us into all this Truth, and bring us to a clear acquaintance with the mind of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>

               <p>§. 1.

               <p n="1">1. That altho' the Law of his Creation was attended both with a promiſe of Reward, and a threatning of Puniſhment, yet the <hi>reaſon of both</hi> is not the <hi>ſame, nor alike neceſſary;</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is of meer Soveraign Bounty, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore might have been either leſs or more, as it pleaſed God, or not propoſed at all, and yet no Injury done; but the Puniſhment threatned is a Debt to Juſtice, and reſults imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the nature of Sin with reference to God, without the Intevention of any Compact; it is due to the Tranſgreſſion of a Divine Law as ſuch, and therefore ſtill due to every Tranſgrſſion of it, even by thoſe that are already cut off from hope of Reward by former Breach of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and as it may not be more then the Offence deſerves without Injury to Man, ſo neither may it be leſs, without a Diminution of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Juſtice, by the ſtrict Rule of which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways meaſured: that Death therefore which was threatned in the Curſe, is in a ſtrict and proper

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>§. 6. From theſe things it is evident that God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> not only upon Terms of <hi>a Law,</hi> but in a way of <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that this Tranſaction with him was of a <hi>Foederal Nature;</hi> and altho it be not in Scripture expreſly called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet it hath the expreſs Nature of a Covenant, and there is no reaſon for Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">

It could only be upon the account of ſuch a Covenant, that his Poſterity ſhould be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they were, in his ſtanding, or falling; let the firſt be denyed, and the latter is altogether unaccountable, for had he only been under a Law to God, his Sin had remained upon himſelf, and could not have redounded upon the whole World of Mankind, as now it doth by a juſt Imputation, no more then the Sin of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon, can now be imputed to another Man that is not actually guilty thereof, at leaſt the Sins of immediate Parents unto their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>And herein lies the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of God with Man, and of his Relation to God thereupon, which did not reſult immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Law of his Creation, but from <hi>the Diſpoſition of a Covenant</hi> according to the <hi>Free, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and wiſe Counſel of God's Will;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho' <hi>the Law of Creation</hi> be eaſily underſtood by Men, and there is little Controverſie about it amongſt thoſe that are not degenerate from all Principles of Reaſon and Humanity; yet <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Creation,</hi> the Intereſt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity with himſelf therein, and the Guilt of original Sin redounding upon them thereby, is not owned
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64928:20"/> by the generality of Mankind, nor can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but by the Light of Divine Revelation; nor is the Heart of Man humbled unto a due Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of it, by a clear and deep Conviction, but by a Work of the Holy Ghoſt. And while Men will meaſure this Counſel of God by their own narrow and dark Reaſon, and refuſe to ſubmit their Sentiments thereabout, to the Revelation of his Soveraign Pleaſure, his unaccountable Will, and Wiſdome, they muſt neceſſarily fall into grievous Miſtakes, and fill the World with fruitleſs Contentions thro' their darkening of Counſel, by words without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
               <p>§. 7. This Covenant that God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and all Mankind in him, as to the Terms and Condition of it (we ſee) was <hi>a Covenant of Works;</hi> with reſpect to immediate Priviledg and Relation, it was <hi>a Covenant of Friendſhip,</hi> and with regard to the Reward promiſed, it was a Covenant of <hi>rich Bounty and Goodneſs;</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded not, nor intimated the <hi>leaſt Iota of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy;</hi> but as while the Law of it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obſerved it raiſed Man within a Degree of the Bleſſed Angels, ſo the Breach of that Law inevitably brought him under that Curſe which did ſink him to the Society of Apoſtate Devils, and left him under a Miſery like to theirs.</p>
               <p>2. Under this Covenant Man was left to the <hi>Freedom of his own Will;</hi> It was in his own
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64928:21"/> Power and Choice, either to obey, and be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy, or to ſin and ſo expoſe himſelf to eternal Miſery; he was not ſo confirmed in Grace, as that he could not ſin and dye, but he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with that Power, and Rectitude of Nature, as that he might not have ſinned, nor ever dyed, tho' he had not a <hi>non poſſe peccare,</hi> and ſo a <hi>non poſſe mori;</hi> yet he had a <hi>poſſe non peccare,</hi> and ſo a <hi>poſſe non mori;</hi> he was a <hi>perfect</hi> tho' a <hi>mutable</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and had all poſſible advantage of <hi>moral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to make him conſtant in his Obedience; he could not be without a clear Conviction of the greateſt Obligation thereunto, both in point of Duty and Gratitude, towards his Creator, and Covenant-God; he had preſent Happineſs, and future Hope in the way of his Duty; and fair warning of the Miſery that Sin would bring upon him, in the denouncing of that Curſe which was the Sanction of the Law given unto him; and yet when the time of Trial comes, all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails not againſt the Temptation, but his <hi>Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> becomes the <hi>Original</hi> of that <hi>Original Sin,</hi> whereby himſelf, and in him the World of Mankind, were ruined and made miſerable.</p>
               <p>§. 8. The next thing therefore to be enquired into is, <hi>The Sin</hi> of our firſt Parents, and then <hi>State and Condition</hi> thereupon.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, Their Tranſgreſſion was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally compleated, by eating of the Fruit of the <hi>Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil</hi> concerning which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64928:21"/> the Lord had commanded them that they ſhould not eat thereof; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. and with reſpect to this let it be obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it was by <hi>the Breach of a poſitive Law</hi> that Mankind was loſt: This was the Door thro' which Sin, and all the Miſeries conſequent thereto, invaded, and by their Entrance ruined this lower World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that Man fell by the Tranſgreſſion of this Poſitive Precept, his <hi>Breach of Covenant</hi> with God was ſo much the more conſpicuous; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this Precept belonged not immediately, and neceſſarily to the <hi>law of his Creation,</hi> but was ſuperadded thereto, as a ſpecial Term and Condition of his <hi>Covenant-Relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Breach of this poſitive Law doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and neceſſarily infer, a Violation of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law of his Creation; this Tranſgreſſion was a total Apoſtacy from God, and in it all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable Wickedneſs was included, even <hi>the luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eyes, and the pride of Life;</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 16. yea all the Villanies that to this day have been, or ever ſhall be perpetrated in the World, are the genuine Fruit thereof; and upon a ſtrict ſearch its Aggravations will be found to be unaccountable.</p>
               <p>§. 9. The State and Condition of Man thus fallen, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ier broken Covenant with God, by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64928:22"/> a wicked and wilful Tranſgreſſion of his holy Law,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He thereby utterly forfeited and loſt all <hi>Covenant-Intereſt in God;</hi> he could no more claim a Right in, or hope for, that Reward which was promiſed on Condition of his perfect Obedience to the Law of that Covenant, which God had made with him; but immediately fell under Guilt, being by the Sentence of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bound over to puniſhment, under the juſt Wrath of the Almighty; and therefore he dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more then the Approach of God to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He did not only forfeit his Right, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Relation to God by this Sin, but moreover he was thereby rendred <hi>uncapable</hi> of true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, inaſmuch as he was now apoſtatized from a Covenant of Friendſhip, to a State of Enmity againſt God, and Alienation from him, which is the neceſſary Adjunct of Wickedneſs; He fell under the <hi>Dominion</hi> of Sin; and that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God wherein he was created, was in a manner wholly defaced; he <hi>ſinned and fell ſhort of the Glory of God;</hi> Rom. 3. 23. And now inſtead of that original Righteouſneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was at firſt beautifyed, there was nothing to be found in him, but abominable Filthineſs, and horrid Deformity; his Mind was covered over, yea poſſeſt with helliſh Darkneſs, Hatred of God reigned in his Heart, and his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were no longer ſubject to right Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64928:22"/> but became vile, and rebellious; and in this State it is evident, he muſt be utterly uncapable of Communion with God, and of the Fruition of him, wherein alone the true Happineſs of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creature doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Curſe of the Law in its utmoſt Rigour, and prime Intendment, was <hi>immediately</hi> and only due to him; and no leſs then the utmoſt Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof was every Moment to be expected by him; and that was <hi>Death,</hi> even the worſt of Deaths, <hi>eternal Death,</hi> which is, <q rend="margQuotes">An everlaſting Puniſhment of Soul and Body, under the wrathful Vengeance of a provoked Deity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now that this was the prime Intendment of the Threatning, might be evinced by many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but at preſent I ſhall content my ſelf with the mention of two only.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Puniſhment will be inflicted on many of the ungodly Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> who have been guilty of no other Tranſgreſſion but that of the Light and Law of Nature; ſuch were thoſe wicked Heathens that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. &amp;c. and Chap. 2. 6,—16. who, tho' they never had the Law written, or knew of any repeated Promulgation thereof, (and therefore we may conclude them much more unlikely to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the new-Covenant and its Terms) yet being a Law to themſelves, were for the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of this Law lyable to this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Now this Puniſhment muſt be the Fruit of that Curſe which is the Sanction of that Law
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64928:23"/> which they were under, and which was tranſgreſſed by them, which was the Law of Creation, even the ſame Law that <hi>Adam</hi> was made under; and if the Law be the ſame, the ſame Penalty was incurred by the Tranſgreſſion thereof; and if they are liable to eternal Death for the Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Law, there is no rational doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> was ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the <hi>juſt Demerit and Wages of Sin</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the threatning (as no doubt it was) it could be no leſs than <hi>an eternal Puniſhment</hi> that was threatned; for if that be not the Deſert of every Sin, it cannot be due to any Sin; for the Reaſon why the Puniſhment of any Sin is <hi>eternal,</hi> is that the Penalty inflicted on the Sinner may be <hi>adequate</hi> to the Offence; the Puniſhment hath an <hi>Infinity</hi> in its <hi>Eternity,</hi> becauſe the Fault is <hi>infinitely aggravated,</hi> and that can only be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of its Object; there is nothing that can be an infinite Aggravation of Sin, but its being committed againſt a God of infinite Greatneſs, Glory, and Goodneſs; and this Aggravation attends every Sin, as it is Sin againſt God, and tho' other Circumſtances may increaſe the Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſo intend the Degree of the Sinners Pain, yet none but this can reach Infinity: The Puniſhment therefore due to <hi>Adam</hi> for Sin againſt God, could be no other or no leſs then eternal Death, which is that intended in the Sanction of the Law given to him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The whole Creation of this viſible
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64928:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> World became lyable to Deſtruction with fallen Man, as an Inheritance forfeited by his Treaſon againſt the Supream Majeſty: By the Sin of Man the Frame of Earth, and the Heavens made for his Service and Delight, was looſed, and their Foundations ſo ſhaken, as would have iſſued in an utter Ruin, had not Chriſt interpoſed and <hi>upheld the Pillars thereof;</hi> Pſal. 75. 3. with Heb. 1. 3. and if the Curſe had been immediately executed in its Rigor, with theſe Deſolations following thereupon, there had been an <hi>Hell ready prepared</hi> for Man; for ſuppoſe, I pray you, all the Lights of Heaven to be put out, the whole Order, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, and Beauty of the Creation to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all reduced to a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſion, and horrid Darkneſs about Man, and the burning Wrath of God kindled upon him, now caſt into the Jaws of eternal Deſpair, and tormented by a Worm that never dyes, (think I ſay of this) and you will hardly be able to conceive of a ſtate more dreadful and diſmal than this, that Man ſtood at the very Brink of.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In this Condition Man was altogether <hi>helpleſs and without Strength,</hi> being utterly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſtand before God upon Terms of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and as uncapable to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon other Terms with God; for he was not able to move one ſtep towards a Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, or the ranſoming of himſelf out of theſe Miſeries: The Door of Repentance was not opened to him by the Covenant of Creation,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64928:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> or if it had, there was in him now neither Power, nor Will to enter in thereat; He was utterly diſabled from obeying God acceptably upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Terms, until made a new Creature: And therefore it was impoſſible, not only that <hi>this Covenant</hi> now broken ſhould be renewed with him, or any of his Poſterity, for the ſame Ends, and in the ſame manner as it was at firſt made with upright Man; but moreover that ever <hi>any Covenant</hi> ſhould be <hi>immediately ſtricken</hi> with him or them, wherein fallen Man ſhould have been the firſt, and immediate Covenanter with God for himſelf, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in his State of Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Thus miſerable (yea more than we have expreſſed, or can expreſs) was the State of fallen Man; Let us now ſee how the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mercy of God was revealed unto him, when he was thus loſt, and miſerably ruined by his own Sin. And for the better underſtanding of what is to follow, I ſhall premiſe two things, which are neceſſary to be kept in our Eye.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the infinitely Wiſe and Gracious God, who from Eternity foreſaw the Fall of Man, had alſo from Eternity a gracious Purpoſe in himſelf, according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his own Will, to redeem <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1, 2.</note> and ſave a Remnant of loſt Mankind from their lapſed and fallen State, and by his All-powerful Grace thro' the Merits of Chriſt,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64928:24"/> to recover them from Miſery to the Inheritance of a Kingdom and Glory far greater than that ſet before <hi>Adam</hi> in his Integrity; And theſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſels that were hid with himſelf, were tranſacted in a way of <hi>Covenant between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son,</hi> even in a Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now revealed in the Scriptures of Truth: And to this Covenant belong all the Promiſes of the Father to the Mediator, and the reſtipulatory Engagements of the Redeemer, about the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sinners and the way and method of its Accompliſhment: And with reſpect to theſe Counſels the Son of God is ſaid to be the Father's Delights, and himſelf alſo to have his Delights in the habitable World, when the Head of the Duſt thereof was formed; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22,—31. In which Context the mutual Acquieſcence both of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, in this admirable Contrivance of infinite Grace and Wiſdom, is not obſcurely ſet forth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In purſuance of this Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Suretiſhip of Chriſt taken therein, upon the Fall of Man, the Government of the World was actually put into the hands of the Son of God, the deſigned Mediator, who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf for the Prevention of its preſent and utter Ruin: And by him were all future Tranſactions managed for the Good of Man, and all Diſcoveries of Grace and Mercy were made to the Children of Men in him, and by him: And all things in Heaven and Earth were brought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64928:25"/> into an order ſubſervient to the Ends of the <hi>new Creation,</hi> and the Redemption of loſt Man to be accompliſhed in the fulneſs of time by the Son of God incarnate: Fallen Man could have no more to do with God, nor God with him in a way of Kindneſs, but in a Mediator.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And from this Deſign of Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it was, that when the Lord God came unto fallen Man in the Garden, in the cool of the Day, and found him filled with Horror and Shame in the Conſcience of his own Guilt, he did not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Rigor of the Law upon him, but held a Treaty with him, which iſſued in a Diſcovery of Grace, whereby a Door of Hope was opened to him, in the laying of a <hi>new Foundation</hi> for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, and walking unto well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing before him. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Sentence paſſed upon the Serpent (which principally concerned the Devil, whoſe Inſtrument he had been in tempting Man, and who probably was made to abide in his Poſſeſſion of the Serpent, till he had received this Doom) <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. there was couched a bleſſed Promiſe of Redemption and Salvation unto Man, which was to be wrought out by the Son of God made of a Woman, and ſo <hi>her Seed;</hi> which Salvation thus promiſed, Man was to receive by Faith, and to hope in it; for in this <hi>implyed Promiſe</hi> was laid the firſt Foundation of the Church after the Fall of Man, which was to be raiſed up out of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64928:25"/> Ruines of the Devil's Kingdom by the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Work by Jeſus Chriſt; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this Commination of the Serpent there is not only implyed a Promiſe of raiſing up a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Seed of the Woman, and ſending him into the World for the breaking of the Serpents Head, that is, the perfect Conqueſt of Satan, and the utter ruining of his Kingdom; but alſo of propagating and preſerving a Church in the World that ſhould be Heirs of that Salvation, and ſhould maintain a ſpiritual War with Satan and his Kingdom, which on their part ſhould end in perfect Conqueſt and Victory; The God of Peace bruiſing Satan under their Feet, while he is nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at their Heel, and making them to be more than Conquerors thro' him that loved them; for the Seed of the Woman is to be underſtood col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively of Chriſt and his members (as the Seed of the Serpent includes all wicked Men) tho' it hath a principal reſpect to Chriſt perſonal, who alone hath obtained the Victory over the infernal Power, and deſtroyed the Works of the Devil; But altho' this was done by himſelf alone, yet was it not for himſelf only, but for his Body the Church, of which every true Believer is a Member, and ſhall certainly obtain Victory thro' the Faith of his Name; And againſt this Church the Gates of Hell can never prevail, but a Church there ever ſhall be in the World, ſo long as the World continues, and ever was ſince the firſt Promiſe, tho' maligned and perſecuted by the Devil and wicked Men, as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64928:26"/> early appears in that Inſtance of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel; Gen.</hi> 4. compared with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 12. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature is intimated in the Name of <hi>Seth,</hi> and the Reaſon given by <hi>Eve</hi> of her impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Name: <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereupon there was a <hi>preſent Reſtraint and Modification of the Curſe</hi> in the Sentence pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> Gen. 3. 16,—19. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by altho' they and their Offspring were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſubjected to many Evils and Miſeries while they lived, and Diſſolution by a temporal Death at laſt, yet they were not immediately laid under a Sentence of <hi>eternal Death</hi> which was the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had deſerved: And concerning this Sentence we may farther obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Promiſe of breaking the Serpents Head which was revealed to our firſt Parents, did not give them a Deliverance from <hi>all Miſery,</hi> but only an Exemption from <hi>eternal Death;</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Promiſe, and all that Chriſt hath now done for the full Accompliſhment thereof, it is the Will of God that all Men, even Believers as well as others, ſhall in this World be exerciſed with Miſeries, and remain ſubject to temporal Death, or Diſſolution of the Body into Duſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Corruptibility</hi> of Man, all the Miſeries he is ſubject to while he lives, and temporal Death at laſt, are the Fruits of Sin, and of the Curſe due to it, as they are natural Evils, or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but yet they are not the Fruit or Reſult of the <hi>Curſe only,</hi> nor the full Wages of Sin; As
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64928:26"/> they are <hi>evil</hi> they flow from the Curſe, but as <hi>temporal only,</hi> the Evil of them is <hi>limited,</hi> and thus <hi>modified</hi> by Mercy, or compaſſionate Goodneſs at leaſt: The Poſition of temporal Death, concludes indeed that Sin is in the World; but this Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Death doth alſo prove, that there is Mercy reſerved for ſome, and that ſuch as obtain not Mercy muſt be brought to an after reckoning, inaſmuch as the Fruit of their Doings hath not fully been repaid to them in this World. And hence,</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are none of theſe Evils but are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a Change, as to their penal Nature, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Change of that Man's State upon whom they come; for tho' they fall as ſo many Drops of Wrath that bode a dreadful Storm coming upon the wicked, yet are they <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Yea ſuppoſing (as there is Reaſon to do) that God did not only promiſe a Redeemer to <hi>Adam</hi> before he pronounced this Sentence, but alſo gave him Faith in the Promiſe, it came immediately upon him as a fatherly Chaſtiſment, and not as a Fruit of unpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Anger.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64928:27"/>
               <p>It is alſo true on the other ſide, that the Godneſs and Forbearance of God is, thro' the Wickedneſs of Man, turned into a <hi>Judgment</hi> upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and Impenitent, who abuſe the day of his Patience unto the <hi>treaſuring up of Wrath againſt the day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God:</hi> Rom. 2. 5. So that both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Mercies and temporal Evils are wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Deſign of God's Glory in the future and eternal State of Man; and we may conclude there had been no ſuch thing as <hi>temporal Death,</hi> if there had not been <hi>a day of Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is more than probable that at the ſame time, or immediately after, God did inſtitute thoſe bloody Sacrifices, that were offered unto him from thenceforth, and accepted by him when offered in Faith, for the further Inſtruction of Man in the general Notion of the way of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the promiſed Seed, and for the Help and Confirmation of his Faith in the Promiſe: Yea even the Coats of Skins which the Lord made, and wherewith he cloathed <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> then confounded with the ſhame of their own Nakedneſs, ſeem to be deſigned of God not only for a natural, but alſo a <hi>myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> were for their Inſtruction concerning that imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs wherein they muſt now ſtand before him, and without which they could find no acceptance with him; Eſpecially if theſe Coats were made of the Skins of thoſe Beaſts that <hi>Adam</hi> was then directed to offer in Sacrifice to God (as ſome
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64928:27"/> conjecture they were) we can hardly imagine leſs to be intended thereby; for no doubt with the Inſtitution of Sacrifices, ſomething of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and End of them</hi> was revealed unto <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This alſo muſt be noted, That altho' the Covenant of Grace was thus far revealed unto <hi>Adam</hi> as we have heard; yet we ſee in all this, there was no formal and expreſs Covenant-Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action with him, much leſs was the Covenant of Grace eſtabliſhed with him as a <hi>publick Perſon</hi> or Repreſentative in any kind; but as he obtained Intereſt for himſelf alone, in the Grace of God thus revealed, <hi>by his own Faith,</hi> ſo muſt thoſe of his Poſterity that are ſaved thereby: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore altho' the Corruption of fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Guilt of his Fall, be from him derived to all his Offspring, becauſe they were in him as a publick Perſon and foederal Root when he fell; yet can they not derive from him any Intereſt in his <hi>renewed</hi> State, or in the Grace or Holineſs thereof; ſeeing with reſpect thereunto God dealt with him only as a <hi>private Perſon;</hi> and the Good of the Promiſe now given out, was no more <hi>intruſted</hi> with him, then with his Poſterity, or any of them in particular.</p>
               <p>§. 12. The State and Condition that the World of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity are now in, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are all born in original Sin, in the Image of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> fallen, and ſo <hi>under a</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Yet are they neceſſarily under the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Law, to obey, worſhip, and ſerve their Creator, tho' they have no <hi>Covenant-Intereſt</hi> in him; for it is impoſſible, and implies a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that reaſonable Creatures ſhould be brought forth into the World, and not be ſubject to the Law of their Creator, or that eternal Death ſhould not be due to the Breach of that Law by them; The Law of Creation binds, when the Covenant of Creation is broken; tho' the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Man hath forfeited his Intereſt in the one, yet it cannot diſſolve the Obligation of the other. But yet,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The World is ſet under a <hi>general Reprieve,</hi> and the full Execution of the deſerved Curſe is delayed until the day of Judgment; until which time the Children of Men are under a Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Goodneſs, and ſparing Mercy, and ſo in a remote Capacity or Poſſibility of obtaining Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, where it pleaſeth God to ſend the Goſpel, the Diſpenſation of which is made effectual for the Salvation of <hi>all the Elect,</hi> who are thereby gathered into the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THE firſt Dawning of the bleſſed Light of God's Grace unto poor Sinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken up in that Promiſe intimated <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. the Redeemed of the Lord were from that time brought into a <hi>new-Relation</hi> to God in and by Chriſt the promiſed Seed, thro' Faith in him as revealed in that Promiſe; and hereupon their Obedience, and religious Service, was ſtated, and accepted of by God upon a <hi>new Foundation,</hi> viz. that of pardoning Mercy, and Forgiveneſs thro' the Redeemer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 4. They were no longer upon Terms of perſonal, and perfect Obedience, or <hi>doing of a Law;</hi> but upon Terms of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>believing a gratuitous Promiſe;</hi> which wholly changed the order of their Acceptation with God: For by the Covenant of Creation, the <hi>Work</hi> of Obedience was to maintain the Relation, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Acceptance of the <hi>Perſon</hi> with God; but by the Covenant of Grace and Redemption, the <hi>Relation and previous Acceptance of the Perſon in Chriſt,</hi> was the reaſon of the good Acceptance of all their ſincere, tho' imperfect <hi>Obedience,</hi> which did now ſpring from Faith: And hence it is ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>God had reſpect to</hi> Abel <hi>and his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:64928:30"/> firſt to the Perſon, and then to his Work; And this order, and way of Salvation, as to the general Nature thereof, ever was, and muſt be, the ſame and invariable in all Ages, and under all different Diſpenſations of God towards his Church.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And as holy Men then lived by Faith, ſo conſequently they had the Object of Faith with them, <hi>viz. The Revelation if God's Counſel by his Word;</hi> Tho' the Word was not <hi>written</hi> till <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, yet was the Church never without God's Oracles; which in thoſe days were made known to it, by thoſe ways and means, that the infinite Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of God made choice of; This we have ſeen in the firſt Promiſe, and in the Inſtitution of Sacrifices, which could not have been offered in Faith, as <hi>Abel</hi>'s was, if God had not commanded and appointed them; yea it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears alſo that God had given them ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Directions what Beaſts they might offer in Sacrifice, and what not; for in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time the diſtinction of Beaſts <hi>clean and unclean,</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as a thing well known before: See <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 2, 3. chap. 8. 20. Unto this we may add that (at leaſt diverſe of) the Names of <hi>Seth</hi>'s Line were impoſed by a Spirit of Prophecy; <hi>Enoch</hi> was a Prophet; and <hi>Noah a Preacher of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> all which do infer a Revelation of the Mind of God, and of his Counſels then made unto the Church, <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the Light, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64928:30"/> 
                  <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and <hi>tranſcending</hi> all the Dictates thereof; altho' it muſt be granted, This Light did not ſhine upon them with the ſame Clearneſs, as it did upon after Ages.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Moreover, The extraordinary Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Providence towards <hi>Enoch, who by Faith walked with God,</hi> and then was <hi>tranſlated</hi> to the heavenly Inheritance without being made ſubject to the common Lot of Mankind in Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution by temporal Death, was not only a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favour to himſelf, but alſo an eminent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to the reſt of the Believers of that Age, that the right of Adoption, and claim of <hi>an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in Light</hi> by Faith, was reſtored to them in the promiſed Seed; and therefore did greatly tend to encourage their Faith and Hope, in the Expectation of a glorious State for Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to be injoyed in a bleſſed Immortality, and eternal Life hereafter; an Earneſt of which they had, in the preſent Injoyment of one Member of that Body to which they were all united. Conf. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5.</p>
               <p>And the very time wherein this was done, doth caſt ſome farther Light upon the myſtical Import thereof: <hi>Enoch</hi> was the <hi>ſeventh from Adam;</hi> and this <hi>Septenary</hi> Number is famous in Scripture, for its myſtical Signification of that perfect Reſt or <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> that Chriſt ſhould bring his Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: And therefore by <hi>Matthew,</hi> the Genealogy of Chriſt is counted by <hi>ſeptenary Generations:</hi> Again,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64928:31"/> The Tranſlation of <hi>Enoch</hi> happened ſoon after the Death of <hi>Adam</hi> (the firſt whoſe <hi>natural Death</hi> is mentioned in Scripture) <hi>Enoch</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Generation was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee Death; As they had ſeen the Fruit of the Curſe exemplified in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Death; ſo they ſaw that Life which the Promiſe gives exemplified in <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Tranſlation; who before he was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>walked with God,</hi> or, as the Apoſtle gives it, <hi>had this Teſtimony, That he pleaſed God;</hi> and indeed the Hebrew Phraſe uſed <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 22. doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie Integrity, and eminent Holineſs, in a private Capacity, but alſo (as the learned <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> notes upon the place) is often uſed for <hi>a pleaſing Adminiſtration of Office before God,</hi> in which reſpect he was a ſpecial Figure of Chriſt; and his Tranſlation, of Chriſt's entring into Heaven, as a Forerunner for us.</p>
               <p>Three hundred Years the Church had injoyed his Miniſtry; and ſeven Patriarchs were left alive as Witneſſes of his Tranſlation; ſo that the whole number of the Sons of God had the Benefit and Comfort of Inſtruction thereby. He propheſied of the Deſtruction of wicked Men, and ſummed up his Prophecy in the Name he gave to his Son <hi>Methuſelach,</hi> which may be interpreted, <hi>They die by a Dart:</hi> or <hi>He dyeth, and then is the Dart;</hi> (i. e. the Dart of Divine Vengeance in Puniſhing the ungodly) or, <hi>he dyeth and then it is ſent:</hi> This was almoſt 1000 years before the Flood; but was exactly fulfilled in the iſſue; For <hi>Methuſelach</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64928:31"/> dyed but about the ſpace of one Month before the Flood came. This Prophecy is more fully ſet down by <hi>Jude</hi> v. 15. (which may be taken as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Paraphraſe upon this Prophetick Name; like <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Interpretation of the Writing upon the Wall) and applyed analogically to the Sinners of his time: for as this firſt Judgment, was a Type of future Judgments upon wicked Men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the Deſtruction of the Jewiſh State by the Fire of God's Wrath, for their rejecting of Chriſt; and each of theſe was a <hi>Praeludium</hi> of the <hi>general Judgment</hi> of the World, ſo the threatning of this firſt Judgment to the ungodly then living, was a denouncing of Judgment againſt all ungodly Sinners, in future times alſo.</p>
               <p>§. 4. In theſe Ages of the Church it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally propagated in that Line, thro' which the Blood of <hi>the promiſed Seed</hi> did run; Yet do we not find any ſuch Partition-Wall ſet up between one Family and another, but any that would might freely aſſociate themſelves, and joyn with the true Worſhippers of God; <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64928:32"/> in an open Contempt of God, and Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. However the Nature and Neceſſity of the thing in it ſelf, in reference to religious Worſhip, and that Obedience that was due to God therein, did oblige his Servants to keep themſelves diſtinct and ſeparate from the reſt of the World: And whilſt they did ſo, the general Defection of Mankind was prevented: But to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Period of the old World, all things declined and grew worſe, and worſe; <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5, 12, 13. The Violence and Corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind abounded; and even the Sons of God were taken with the bait of ſenſual Delights: And thoſe who had formerly kept up a pure and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Communion for the ſolemn worſhipping of God by <hi>calling upon his Name,</hi> and therefore had alſo his Name <hi>called upon them,</hi> Gen. 4. <hi>ult.</hi> being denominated <hi>the Sons of God;</hi> did now loſe the ſenſe of Religion, and brake the Bounds of their juſt Separation, and mingled themſelves with <hi>the Daughters of Men,</hi> Gen. 6. 24. Theſe were the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Offspring, or of Confederacy with his Seed, by whoſe Beauty they were entangled, while they regarded more the gratifying of their Luſt, than the true Ends of Marriage; and being thus entangled were alſo drawn in a Partnerſhip with them in their Abominations; Inſomuch that when the time of the Flood came, the pure Worſhip of God was maintained in the Family of <hi>Noah</hi> only, who <hi>found Grace in the ſight of God;</hi> Gen. 6. 1-11. and was preſerved in the Ark,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64928:32"/> that by him and his Sons the deſolate Earth might be again repleniſht with Inhabitants, after <hi>the Foundation of the Wicked had been deſtroyed with a Flood:</hi> Job 22. 16.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Now in the dealings of God with <hi>Noah</hi> there are ſome things call for our diligent Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as carrying on to a farther degree of Light, the Diſcovery of Grace and Redemption by Chriſt; and ſo the farther Eſtabliſhment of the Church in Expectation thereof. For,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ark</hi> which <hi>Noah</hi> being warned of God, built by his ſpecial Direction, for the ſaving of himſelf, and his Houſe, which were <hi>eight Souls,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. did not only afford him and them a temporal Deliverance from the Deluge of Waters, by which God in his Wrath then ſwept away a diſobedient World; but was moreover uſeful by its <hi>typical Reſpect</hi> for their farther Inſtruction about the Redemption of Man, from the Floods of divine Vengeance to be hereafter poured out in eternal Wrath upon the World of Unbelievers. For this is to be obſerved concerning the State of the Church before Chriſt came in the Fleſh; That as the Goſpel was preached unto them by Types and dark Shadows, ſo this kind of Inſtruction was afforded them, not only by the <hi>ſtated Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> of Ceremonious Worſhip, but alſo by many <hi>extraordinary Works of Providence,</hi> which were ſo ordered by Divine Wiſdom, as that they might bear a typical Reſpect unto, and be an apt Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64928:33"/> of, ſpiritual things: This may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in many Inſtances in the Hiſtory of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and of his offspring the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> On this account the Manna they did eat in the Wilderneſs is called <hi>ſpiritual Meat,</hi> and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Rock which they drank, <hi>ſpiritual Drink;</hi> and <hi>the Rock Chriſt:</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 3, 4. and yet we read of no ſpecial Ordination, or Appointment of theſe things unto ſuch an End, but what they had from <hi>the Order and Voice</hi> of Providence, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the peculiar Circumſtances of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple concerned in them. And under this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration doth <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark come, which either was a Type of Chriſt, (as the Ark in the Jewiſh Sanctuary) or of the Church conſidered as guarded with his Salvation; which in the Iſſue will come near to the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>And this Type is rendered the more lively by the <hi>Form of Structure</hi> which God commanded; and alſo the unwonted Uſe of one Term in the Direction given for the ſecuring of their Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who were to enter into the Ark.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Form</hi> in which the Ark was built, in the Proportion of its Dimenſions comes neareſt to that of the Body of a Man; for it was in length 300 Cubits, in breadth 50, and in height 30: So that in Figure is was ſhaped like <hi>a Coffin;</hi> and there was a Reſemblance of Burial in the entring thereinto, and of a Reſurrection in coming out of it; In which reſpect the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes Baptiſm to be the Antitype to the Ark, 1 <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64928:33"/> 19, 20. And thus was the Ark an <hi>extraordinary Sacrament,</hi> or Prefiguration of the Churches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation, by the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt; and of her Union, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him that dyed and roſe again, ſo as to enjoy all the Benefits of his Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Directions given for the building of the Ark, <hi>Noah</hi> is commanded to <hi>pitch it with Pitch both within and without,</hi> Gen. 6. 14. the Words in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> are <hi>Caphartà Baccophèr:</hi> The firſt ſence of the <hi>Verb</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:64928:34"/>
               <p>Now tho' we have no reaſon to think that theſe things could be then apprehended ſo diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly, as we now ſee them by the Light of the New Teſtament; yet have we good ground to believe that ſome <hi>general Knowledg</hi> of them was conveyed to the Minds of the Faithful, in the time of this <hi>Type,</hi> and by <hi>means thereof:</hi> And this will inform us how <hi>Noah became an Heir of the Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> by building the Ark, and entring thereinto: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. ſeeing there was not only a Proof of his Obedience herein, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Truth of his Faith was manifeſted, but moreover his Faith did reach, and in ſome Degree apprehend, the Myſtical uſe of the <hi>Ark</hi> which he was building; and while his hands were buſied in the external Work thereof, and his Life ſecured by his abode in it, his Faith was exerciſed about that ſpiritual and eternal Salvation, that was ſhadowed and typically repreſented by it.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Upon rhe entrance of <hi>Noah</hi> into the Ark, and alſo at his coming out thence, we find mention made of God's <hi>eſtabliſhing his Covenant with him:</hi> ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 18. &amp; chap. 9. 11. And this is the firſt Place and Occaſion of the <hi>explicite mention</hi> of a <hi>Covenant</hi> in the Scriptures; and therefore we are the more obliged to a ſerious inquiry after the true Nature, and import of this Covenant; ſome Obſervations upon it we ſhall collect, according as things are preſented in the order of their Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by <hi>Moſes;</hi> only let this be premiſed;</p>

                  </q> &amp;c. God's <hi>making</hi> of a Covenant, is the <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Promiſe is a full, and ſufficient Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he will perform to the end, what is engaged for therein: The Benefit immediately promiſed, is, the Preſervation of <hi>Noah,</hi> and all that were with him in the Ark; and the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation required of him, was, A believing Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of himſelf to God, in an obedient uſe of thoſe Means of ſafety which he had ordained.</p>
               <p>This at firſt view ſeems to import no more than an outward and temporal Favour; but if diligently looked into, we ſhall diſcern a great deal more in it; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this Benefit of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Covenant there was not only a <hi>temporal</hi> Salvation ſecured to him, and his Houſe, but moreover his <hi>eternal Salvation,</hi> yea, the Salvation of the <hi>whole Church</hi> was inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein, and did wholly depend thereupon; ſeeing, <hi>the promiſed Seed</hi> which ſhould break the Serpent's Head was not yet <hi>brought forth;</hi> and therefore if all Mankind had been <hi>now</hi> deſtroyed,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64928:35"/> that <hi>firſt and great Promiſe</hi> (which was a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sum of the Covenant of Redemption) had failed, and ſo the whole Covenant unto which it did belong, had been <hi>evacuated,</hi> and made of none effect: And with reſpect to this alſo as well as the Certainty of it in it ſelf, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe here given to <hi>Noah</hi> in a foederal way, is aptly ſaid to be <hi>an eſtabliſhing of God's Covenant with</hi> Noah, ſeeing this Covenant was made with him <hi>purſuant of</hi> that gracious Deſign of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption before revealed, which as it was never ſuſpended upon the <hi>Worthineſs</hi> of Man, ſo God by Covenant aſſures <hi>Noah,</hi> its Accompliſhment ſhould never be prevented by his <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Add to this the typical Reſpect of the <hi>Ark,</hi> and you will diſcern that under this Covenant was implyed, and darkly ſhadowed, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of eternal Salvation by Chriſt; even as the Promiſe of the heavenly Inheritance unto Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, was afterwards couched in the Promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed.</p>
               <p>§. 7. What paſt after <hi>Noah</hi> was come out of the Ark, you have recorded in <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. from <hi>v.</hi> 20, <hi>to the end of the Chapter,</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. In which Hiſtory you may obſerve;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That before any farther Tranſaction of God with <hi>Noah,</hi> there was a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> offered unto the Lord by him, in which the Lord <hi>ſmelled a ſweet Savour,</hi> or, a <hi>ſavour of Reſt,</hi> Gen. 8. 21. This Phraſe of <hi>ſmelling a ſweet Savour,</hi> ſignifies the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64928:35"/> of his Offering; and this <hi>Savour</hi> did ariſe from the typical reſpect of this Offering to the Sacrifice of Chriſt <hi>(Confer Eph.</hi> 5. 2.) and the Faith of him that ſacrificed, which was thro' it directed to the ſame Object: And this is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, That all which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, was tranſacted in the <note n="*" place="margin">Chriſt's Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sacrifice is the cauſe of God's Forbearance towards the World</note> Intereſt of this Sacrifice, and is ſome way to be referred to the ends thereof. From this Paſſage you may look back to <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 29. and you will find the reaſon of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi>'s giving the name of <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>And he called his Name</hi> Noah, <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Noah</hi> to his Son explained thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Bleſſings of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Covenant are firſt conceived in a gracious Purpoſe of God's Heart; <hi>And the Lord ſaid in his Heart, I will not again curſe,</hi> &amp;c. and are afterwards put into the Promiſes of the Covenant wherein God ingageth himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them; chap. 9. 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equivalent to an Oath, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 9. <hi>I have ſworn that the Waters of</hi> Noah <hi>ſhould no more go over the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The particular Benefits and Bleſſings given to Mankind by this Covenant, were, 1. Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for the repleniſhing of the Earth. 2. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minon over the Creatures, and the free uſe of them for Food. 3. Aſſurance that the Judgment which they had now eſcaped ſhould not be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated;</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:64928:36"/> notwithſtanding that after-Generations were like to prove as wicked as thoſe that had gone before them, ſeeing the ſame Root and Spring of Corruption remained in them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. And the <hi>Rainbow</hi> was appointed to be the <hi>viſible Sign</hi> and Token of this Covenant: <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 12-17.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I ſhall content my ſelf to have thus briefly pointed at; and farther we have to Note,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Diſpenſation of Goodneſs, and Forbearance which the World was ſet under by the firſt Promiſe, was now ratified by a ſolemn Covenant; wherein alſo was enſured the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Generation of Mankind for the Production of the promiſed Seed, both as <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Viz,</hi> The <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> and his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> 
                  <hi>perſonally, and collectively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered:</hi> And this Aſſurance raiſed the Faith of the Church one Degree higher than it had before attained to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Covenant had alſo its Myſtical Uſe to the Faithful, as ſhadowing the Covenant of Grace by Chriſt; and the Ratification thereof in the Blood of his Sacrifice, by which we are ſaved from the Curſe, and reſtored to a ſanctified Right in Creature-Comforts, and the Hope of eternal Life: And the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with the <hi>Abſoluteneſs</hi> of his Promiſe in this Covenant, are inſtanced as a ſingular Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Faith of the Church in reference to the Promiſe of that Grace that reigns in the New
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64928:36"/> Covenant: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 9. And the Token of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is made the Emblem of the Stedfaſtneſs, and eternal Memorial of the other <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Rainbow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Throne,</hi> notes God's regard to his Coveannt in the Government of the World; All the Adminiſtration of Providence is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 3. ſo that in the typical reſpect of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Light of divine Grace, and Mercy, did dawn upon the Church with ſome more Clearneſs then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Covenant is ſaid to be made with <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Sons, and <hi>their Seed after them,</hi> and that for <hi>perpetual Generations;</hi> the Terms are parallel with thoſe we meet with in the 17th <hi>Chapter</hi> in the Covenant made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> for <hi>his Seed in their Generations:</hi> And yet here two things are evident;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That remote Generations to the end of the World, are as much concerned in this Covenant as their immediate Offspring with whom it was firſt made, and have equal Claim to the Bleſſings of it with them, without any conſideration had of their immediate Parents. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. That altho' the Grace of the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was <hi>myſtically held forth in</hi> this Covenant with <hi>Noah,</hi> which was thus ſtricken with him for <hi>all his Poſterity,</hi> yet were not the Grace and Bleſſings thereof by this means <hi>intailed upon all Mankind;</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of typical Bleſſings to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s carnal Seed, and their <hi>Intereſt</hi> in them.</note> They have all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, an intereſt in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64928:37"/> that <hi>ſignified,</hi> and ſome ways included ſpiritual Bleſſings, but thoſe Bleſſings appertain not <hi>to all</hi> that have the <hi>Signs of them,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the <hi>peculiar Right</hi> of thoſe that do by Faith receive them, <hi>Who are born not of Bloods, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</hi> Joh. 1. 13.</p>
               <p>§. 8. In the following Part of this Hiſtory <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Curſe of <hi>Cham</hi> upon his Son <hi>Canaan,</hi> prepared the way to the Bleſſing of <hi>Shem</hi> in his Poſterity by <hi>Abraham;</hi> for by the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Curſe were the <hi>Canaanites</hi> afterwards diſinherited, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> planted in their room. And in this prophetick Curſe on <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Bleſſing on <hi>Shem</hi> you may read, what is after noted by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 32. 8. It is alſo worthy of our Notice; That <hi>the Seal</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Covenant by virtue of which they inherited the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> kept alive the <hi>Remembrance of</hi> Cham'<hi>s Wickedneſs,</hi> and was a perpetual <hi>warning</hi> to them, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into his Steps: He was condemned to ſervitude for <hi>looking upon the Nakedneſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and they were <hi>circumciſed in the foreskin of their Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Bleſſing of <hi>Shem,</hi> ſpecial Regard is had to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whoſe <hi>bringing forth</hi> into the World, was now <hi>limited</hi> to the Line of <hi>Shem;</hi> and therefore <hi>in his Bleſſing</hi> is the Spring of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>'s Bleſſing alſo. <hi>Shem</hi> is the firſt of whom
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64928:37"/> it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>the Lord was his God:</hi> And by <hi>the Lord God of Shem</hi> Chriſt <hi>who is now over all, God bleſſed for ever,</hi> is intended; whoſe Name is here <hi>celebrated by Noah,</hi> as the only Hope and Salvation of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Bleſſing of <hi>Japhet</hi> in the Intereſt of <hi>Shem</hi>'s Bleſſing, doth not only ſignifie his <hi>perſonal Intereſt</hi> in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> who was to come of <hi>Shem,</hi> but alſo the <hi>calling of the Gentiles</hi> of his Poſterity, to be joynt Heirs with the Jews in the Bleſſings of the New-Covenant; yea his <hi>dwelling in the Tents of Shem,</hi> doth intimate moreover the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> of the Gentile Church unto the Church of the Jews, who were to be diſinherited of all Covenant-Intereſt for their rejecting of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah:</hi> In that Paſſage, <hi>God ſhall</hi>

               <p>§. 9. Some time after theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> about the fourth Generation, we find that according to the Bleſſing of God upon <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 1. there was a very great Increaſe of Men in the World; and as they increaſed, they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently drew upon themſelves the ſame Charge that was laid upon the Old World; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Imagination of their Heart was evil from their Youth;</hi> For in the days of <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Peleg</hi> there was a very general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64928:38"/> and Rebellion againſt God, managed by the Children of Men <hi>at Babel;</hi> in purſuance of which they began to build a Tower there: <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 1-9. And it is very probable <hi>Nimrod</hi> that mighty Hunter was one chief Doer in the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: (for, <hi>A Defection from the true Religion, and Tyrannous Oppreſſion, uſually go hand in hand)</hi> But this their rebellious Enterprize was interrupted by the <note n="*" place="margin">This gave the Name to the place <hi>Babel</hi> ſignifying <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Confuſion of Languages</hi> that God brought upon them; And hereupon the Hebrew Tongue which before was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, remained in its Purity only with the Family of <hi>Heber</hi> (from whom it alſo had its particular Denomination) and ſuch other of the Patriarchs and holy Men then living as had not joyned themſelves with theſe Workers of Iniquity in their curſed Deſign; And on this occaſion <hi>Heber</hi> hath a ſpecial Honour put upon him, as you may collect from <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 21. where <hi>Shem</hi> is in a peculiar manner ſaid to be <hi>the Father of all the Children of Heber.</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> with his Poſterity the Heirs of <hi>Shem</hi>'s Bleſſing, are from him denominated <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. Now by this Confuſion of Languages the Children of Men fell under a <hi>greater Evil,</hi> than poſſibly at the firſt thought we may be aware of; for it did not only fruſtrate their preſent Deſign, and alſo render the means of their civil Converſe difficult for the future, and the Attainment of all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64928:38"/> Knowledg in things natural, full of Labour and Travel; but, which is far more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was virtually a kind of <hi>Excommunication</hi> from the Church then in being, with whom the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue remained, that was from this time unintelligible to the greateſt part of the World beſides; And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the after Diſpenſation of God towards the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> this Diverſity of their Language from that of the reſt of the World, was as the Addition of a <hi>natural Fortification</hi> to that <hi>Wall of Separation,</hi> whereby the Nations were excluded from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Church, and left deſtitute of that Bleſſing (which of all other was the greateſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2.) of the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> which were committed to them in the Hebrew Tongue: And therefore for many Ages they remained <hi>Strangers to the Covenant of Promiſe,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. living in the darkeſt Cloud of Ignorance and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and ſo <hi>without Hope, and without God in the World.</hi> And this diſmal Effect of the preſent Judgment, remained upon them generally, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the <hi>times of Reſtitution and Refreſhing,</hi> even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the <hi>laſt Days,</hi> wherein God would perſwade <hi>Japhet,</hi> and bring him into the Tents of <hi>Shem:</hi> And then a Door was opened for the breaking up of Light to the Gentiles, <hi>by the Gift of Tongues at</hi> Jeruſalem, whereby the Apoſtles and Prophets of the New-Teſtament were enabled to preach the Goſpel to all Nations in their own Tongue; and thus the <hi>Salvation of God in Zion</hi> became a

                  <hi>Light to the Gentiles,</hi> whoſe Darkneſs was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally brought upon them by the <hi>Confuſion of Tongues at Babel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither did the Judgment of God upon this Evil Generation ſtop here, for their Days were alſo <hi>ſhortned,</hi> and cut off in Anger for their Sin, and that to <hi>the half</hi> of them: for you may obſerve in the Genealogy, <hi>Gen. 11th,</hi> that as none which were born after the Flood, attained to the Years of thoſe that lived before it, ſo moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly the ordinary Age of Man was again ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the time of this Defection at <hi>Babel;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that none of the Generations after <hi>Heber,</hi> attained to more than about <hi>half</hi> the number of his Years.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THE next <hi>ſignal Advance</hi> that was made of the Diſcovery of God's Grace to Men, was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, and by the <hi>Foederal</hi> Tranſactions of God with him, whereby he was brought into ſuch a <hi>Relation</hi> to God, and the whole Church, as was in ſome reſpects peculiar to himſelf, and never was the Lot of any other of the Children of Men either before or ſince his time; in reſpect of which <hi>Abraham</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a Type of Chriſt, who is eminently <hi>the Head and Prince</hi> of the new Covenant; And becauſe of that ſpecial Grace and Favour that the Lord beſtowed upon him in his Tranſactions with him, is he ſtyled <hi>The Friend of God:</hi> And the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64928:40"/> Covenant is ſaid to be <hi>Mercy to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and Truth to</hi> Jacob; <hi>Mic. 7. ult.</hi> intimating the <hi>beginning</hi> of it to be with <hi>Abraham</hi> which was of meer Grace and Mercy, tho' when once made with him, the <hi>Truth and Faithfulneſs</hi> of God was ingaged to make it good to the <hi>ſucceeding Heirs</hi> thereof: not but that the Covenant of Grace as made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was the ſame for Subſtance, that had been more darkly revealed in the Ages before, but it pleaſed God to tranſact it with him as he had not done with any before him. It may be noted alſo that <hi>Abraham</hi> is the firſt Man in the World unto whom God is ſaid to have <hi>appeared</hi> or <hi>been ſeen,</hi> Act. 7. 2. with Gen. 12.</p>
               <p>§. 2. This <hi>Abraham</hi> was of the Poſterity of <hi>Shem,</hi> deſcended from him in the <hi>Tenth Generation,</hi> and choſen of God from amongſt all his rumerous Offspring to be in an eſpecial manner <hi>the Heir of his Bleſſing:</hi> Gen. 11. Yet are we not to imagine that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Family were the <hi>only People</hi> that God had in the World in his Days; for altho' there was then a very great Defection of the World from God and his true Worſhip, yet was it not <hi>univerſal</hi> as in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time; but there were many alive that did truly fear God, and were accepted with him, beſides <hi>Abraham</hi> and thoſe immediately depending on him; for even <hi>Shem</hi> lived till <hi>Abraham</hi> was 150 years old; and <hi>Arphaxad</hi> lived till he was 88, which was 13 years after that Covenant was confirmed with him,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64928:41"/> mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>Salah</hi> lived until <hi>Abraham</hi> was 118 years of Age, which was about 19 years after the Covenant of Circumciſion was given to him: And <hi>Heber</hi> lived after his Death, even until <hi>Jacob</hi> was about 19 years old (for he was the longeſt Liver of all that were born after the Flood) And there is no doubt but theſe <hi>Patriarchs</hi> with their Houſes, and others joyning with them, and under their Conduct, did worſhip and ſerve the true God; yet it pleaſed the Lord to ſingle out <hi>Abraham,</hi> call him to his Foot, and make him an <hi>Head</hi> of all future Covenants with Men; And this, notwithſtanding ſuch a Bar lay in his way at the time of his calling, as to his entering into any ſuch Relation, as was impoſſible to have been removed, but by Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Grace and Power; And that both upon a <hi>Moral and Phyſical</hi> Account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon a <hi>Moral Account: Abraham</hi> was not a Perſon eminent for Holineſs and Religion; when God called him to inherit <hi>Shem</hi>'s Bleſſing, he was not better or more deſerving then any of the reſt of his Poſterity, but was ſwiming down the Stream of a wicked World, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from the Religion and Piety of his <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> unto falſe Worſhip and Idolatry; <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 2, 3. And therefore it is not without reaſon that the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 16. 3. upbraids the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with this, that <hi>their Father was an Amorite, and their Mother an Hittite,</hi> not <hi>properly</hi> but <hi>metaphorically</hi> ſo called, becauſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64928:41"/> even they had been involved in the Guilt of <hi>like Apoſtacy</hi> from God as theſe Nations, before the Lord graciouſly <hi>called</hi> them out of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon a <hi>natural Account;</hi> For <hi>Sarai</hi> the Wife of <hi>Abraham</hi> was barren, and noted to be ſo before God called him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 30. And yet the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Shem</hi> muſt have been loſt, the hope of the Church periſhed, and all Covenant-Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with <hi>Abraham</hi> proved of <hi>none Effect,</hi> if he had not had <hi>Seed;</hi> foraſmuch as by virtue of God's Covenant to be eſtabliſhed with him, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> (as concerning the Fleſh) was to come of him; And yet all this was no Impediment, or Obſtruction in his way, <hi>who quickeneth the dead, and calleth the things that are not as tho' that were.</hi> Rom. 4.</p>
               <p>§. 3. There is one thing more to be premitted to the Conſideration of God's Covenant-Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions with <hi>Abraham</hi> in particular, which we have moſt clearly ſtated in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That with reſpect to them <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be conſidered in a double Capacity, both as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of all true <hi>Believers,</hi> and as the <hi>Father</hi> and Root of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh Nation,</hi> and for both theſe <hi>Seeds</hi> God did enter into Covenant with him; howbeit theſe <hi>Seeds</hi> being formally diſtinguiſht the one from the other, their Covenant Intereſt muſt of neceſſity be <hi>diverſe,</hi> and fall under a diſtinct Conſideration; and the Bleſſings appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64928:42"/> to either, muſt be conveyed in a way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to their peculiar and reſpective Covenant-Intereſt; And theſe things may not be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a manifeſt Hazard of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Articles in the Chriſtian Religion; And yet ſuch is the <hi>mutual reſpect</hi> of all God's Covenant-Tranſactions with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſuch was to be his Diſpenſation towards the Church for ſome Ages following, as did require a <hi>preſent Intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the Promiſes, and an involving of ſpiritual Bleſſings in the ſhade of temporal, and of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed in a natural. This I ſuppoſe is more evident then to admit a Denyal; and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Covenants made with him the Scripture ſpeaks not of; neither can we prove thereby, That any of the Covenants given to him, were tranſacted with him ſimply under the Notion, or in <hi>the Relation of, an ordinary believing Parent, or Head of a particular Houſhold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore for the better underſtanding of theſe things, it is neceſſary that with due Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both to the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>the New,</hi> we humbly enquire concerning,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Covenant of Grace as made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Covenant made with him for his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Offspring; And</item>
                  <item>3. Their mutual Reſpect, and Dependence one upon the other.</item>
               </list>
               <p>§. 4. To begin with the firſt: That God did
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64928:42"/> reveal the Covenant of Grace to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as alſo the general nature of that Covenant, and the Seed concerned in it, we have plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that Account which the Holy Ghoſt gives of it, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp; 16, 17. Verſes; which I ſhall here tranſcribe at large;</p>
               <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Even as</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was accounted to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. <hi>Know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the ſame are the Children of</hi> Abraham.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>And the Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen thro' Faith, preached before the Goſpel unto</hi> Abraham (ſaying) <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. <hi>So then they which be of Faith, are bleſſed with faithful</hi> Abraham.</p>
               <p>16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made: he ſaith not, And to Seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. <hi>And this I ſay, that the Covenant that was confirm'd before of God in Chriſt, the Law which was four hundred and thirty years, after cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the Promiſe of none effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Words contain the whole of what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in this Diſcourſe; the Sum of which, as to my preſent Purpoſe, I ſhall briefly collect in ſome Obſervations upon them.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Firſt, That the Goſpel was preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Covenant of Grace revealed to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64928:43"/> him, we have aſſerted in ſuch full Terms in this <hi>Context</hi> as none can rationally doubt thereof; and moreover in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. we have <hi>the Time</hi> of God's eſtabliſhing this Covenant with him exactly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: It was (ſaith the Text) 430 <hi>years before the giving of the Law;</hi> Gal. 3. 17. <hi>(viz.</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai)</hi> Now the Law was given in a very little time after the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> And from the giving of the <hi>firſt Promiſe</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which we have recorded <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. unto that very Night in which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were brought out of their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, is the Computation of theſe Years made, as will be evident to him that ſhall diligently compare the <hi>Chronology</hi> of thoſe times with the expreſs Teſtimony of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 12. 41. <hi>And it came to paſs at the end of the 430 years, even the ſelf ſame day it came to paſs that all the Hoſts of the Lord went out from the Land of</hi> Egypt. From the time of the firſt Promiſe to the end of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing in <hi>Egypt</hi> was 430 years, tho' their Abode in <hi>Egypt</hi> was not near ſo long. And from hence we collect,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the Tranſaction of God with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> recorded <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. he did ſolemnly confirm his Covenant with him (altho' <hi>Moſes</hi> makes not expreſs mention of the Term <hi>Covenant</hi> until ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion be offered <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 18.) For the <hi>Promiſe there mentioned,</hi> the Apoſtle aſſerts to be <hi>the Covenant confirmed of God in Chriſt unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:64928:43"/>2. The Mercy of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Redemption out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was in ſome reſpect to be referred to this Covenant as the Spring thereof (tho' it was not immediately and in its own nature a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Bleſſing to all that did partake in it) And all the dealings of God with them as a ſelect and peculiar People in Covenant with himſelf, were in <hi>Subſerviency</hi> to the great Ends of <hi>this Covenant with Abraham;</hi> and therefore none of them may be interpreted to the Prejudice or <hi>diſannulling</hi> of thoſe Promiſes in which the Goſpel was preached unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By the Computation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 12. it appears, That the Promiſe we are ſpeaking of was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> on the 15th day of the Month <hi>Abib</hi> (the firſt Month according to the religious Account of the Jews) on which day <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Typical Church, obtained a Typical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in the Intereſt of a Typical Paſſover; And on that ſame day Chriſt our true Paſſover was ſacrificed for us upon the Croſs, obtained eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and by confirming the Covenant of Grace with his own Blood, paſſed all the Promiſes thereof into <note n="*" place="margin">The Covenant of Grace is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by us a <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Covenant.</hi> Conf. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. Secondly, The <hi>Sum</hi> and Subſtance of all ſpiritual and eternal Bleſſings was <hi>included</hi> in the Covenant and <hi>Promiſe</hi> given unto <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:64928:44"/> Gen. 12. In theſe words: <hi>I will bleſs thee, and thou ſhalt be a Bleſſing;</hi> The Grace and Bleſſings of the New-Covenant were given and enſured unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> for <hi>himſelf;</hi> and moreover this <hi>Honour</hi> was conferred on him, That he ſhould be <hi>an Head</hi> of Covenant-Bleſſings, as the <hi>Father</hi> of all true <hi>Believers;</hi> No leſs is intended in thoſe words, <hi>thou ſhalt be a Bleſſing;</hi> They ſuppoſe indeed that <hi>He</hi> ſhould <hi>be bleſſed,</hi> but the Promiſe terminates not in <hi>himſelf,</hi> but alſo <hi>conveys Bleſſedneſs</hi> to many others thro' a Relation to him as <hi>his Children;</hi> which is yet more fully expreſt in that which follows: <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed;</hi> This general Promiſe intends not, that every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in every Nation ſhould at any time be bleſſed in <hi>Abraham;</hi> but that his Bleſſing ſhould not be confined to any <hi>one Nation</hi> excluding others, and that <hi>all in every Nation</hi> that were bleſſed, ſhould be ſo by virtue of the Covenant now made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in a <hi>Relation</hi> to him as their <hi>Father:</hi> This was <hi>the Goſpel preached unto Abraham;</hi> and a Promiſe of the <hi>Juſtification of the Heathen thro' Faith:</hi> Gal. 3. 8. and in the Intereſt of this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> they <hi>receive the Promiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> as being <hi>his Seed</hi> ver. 14. And this Promiſe, of a believing Seed which ſhould with himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace, was farther confirmed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> a conſiderable time after this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3, 18.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:64928:44"/>
               <p>§. 7. Thirdly, This Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> in and thro' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> It is not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is <hi>the firſt Head</hi> thereof; in and by him all the Promiſes of it are ratified, as he was the <hi>Surety of the Covenant:</hi> Heb. 7. 22. and <hi>in him they are all Yea and Amen,</hi> 2. Cor. 1. From whom all the Grace of the Covenant is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived upon poor Sinners thro' <hi>Faith</hi> in his Name. This the Apoſtle aſſerts moſt clearly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. and argues it from the Form of the Promiſes as made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> ver. 16. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Abraham and his Seed were the Promiſes made; he ſaith not unto Seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scope of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe will teach us that thoſe Promiſes are meant which relate to the Juſtification and Salvation of poor Sinners; even ſuch as include that Grace by which the Gentiles are called to inherit eternal Life; ſome do principally refer this to <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. and it will readily be granted that ſome of thoſe Promiſes that <hi>ultimately</hi> reſpect the <hi>ſpiritual Seed</hi> and <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bleſſings,</hi> are ſometimes given to <hi>Abraham</hi> under <hi>the Covert</hi> of thoſe Terms that have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reſpect unto his <hi>natural Seed</hi> and <hi>temporal Bleſſings</hi> as made Types of the other; and when they are ſo, the Promiſe ſtill runs <hi>to his Seed,</hi> in the ſingular Number; which the holy Ghoſt may here teach us to be on ſet purpoſe to gather up our Thoughts to <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, as the <hi>Spring and Root</hi> of <hi>Abraham's Bleſſing,</hi> when we conſider the <hi>myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:64928:45"/> import of ſuch Promiſes. But this being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, That the Apoſtle hath the form of that Promiſe in his Eye, we cannot from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Promiſe is made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed both natural and myſtical in one and the ſame Tenour; but only thus much will fairly follow upon it, That the Apoſtle argues from the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Seed as typical, to the ſpiritual Seed as typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby; and ſo arguing makes ſpecial Uſe of <hi>the Terms</hi> in which the Promiſe is made, as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely <hi>fitted</hi> to its <hi>typical reſpect</hi> or myſtical ſence. So is the Prohibition of breaking a Bone of the Paſchal Lamb, which was <hi>a Type</hi> of Chriſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by <hi>John</hi> to Chriſt himſelf who was <hi>typified</hi> thereby: <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 36. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 46.</p>
               <p>Howbeit (I conceive) the Apoſtle hath here a direct and ſpecial Eye to that Promiſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. <note n="*" place="margin">This Promiſe is particularly cited by <hi>Peter,</hi> as a ſummary of the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> Act. 3. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>In thy Seed ſhall all the Families of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> which runs directly parallel both in Terms and Sence with the <hi>Promiſe</hi> given to <hi>Abraham</hi> Gen. 12. 3. which was before pleaded by him: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. This Promiſe was given forth in the Repetition and Confirmation of the Covenant before made with him, upon the occaſion of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s having offered up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> whereby the Death and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt Jeſus was in a moſt lively manner prefigured; And clearly holds forth thus much, That as all Nations ſhould be bleſſed in a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64928:45"/> to <hi>Abraham</hi> as his Children, ſo that Bleſſing ſhould be derived upon them thro' <hi>Intereſt in Chriſt</hi> his promiſed Seed, and by the Efficacy of his <hi>Mediation</hi> in the Intereſt of <hi>that Sacrifice and Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a ſweet ſmelling Savour,</hi> Eph. 5. 2. that in the fulneſs of time he ſhould make unto God. And if it be objected, that the Promiſe there is made <hi>of</hi> or <hi>concerning Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and not <hi>to</hi> his Seed; let it be minded that all the Promiſes made <hi>of this Seed (viz.</hi> Chriſt) in one reſpect, may be ſaid to be made <hi>to this Seed</hi> in another, becauſe they are originally eſtabliſhed in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>Covenant of Redemption</hi> that was between the Father and him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Strong</hi> of the Covenant p. 126.</note> Some do interpret this Text in <hi>Gal.</hi> of <hi>Chriſt myſtical,</hi> becauſe of the order of the Words, The Promiſe is made firſt unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> then unto his Seed; therefore (ſay they) it is ſuch a Seed as comes to have Right in the Promiſe; <hi>Secondly,</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and as his Children; And alſo becauſe the Apoſtles Scope is to prove that the Gentiles are juſtified by Faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was. But I ſhould rather apply them to Chriſt as <hi>perſonally</hi> conſidered; For <hi>the Seed</hi> to whom the Promiſe is made, is the ſame <hi>in whom all the Nations of the Earth are bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 22. 18. Now altho' as all Believers being the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are bleſſed with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet are they not <hi>that Seed in whom</hi> all Nations are bleſſed, but <hi>the Nations</hi> who are bleſſed in <hi>this Seed:</hi> And in the very
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64928:46"/> next Verſe the Covenant is ſaid to be eſtabliſhed of God <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in</hi> or <hi>unto Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>ſame Seed</hi> ſpoken of in the preceding Verſe; Now the Covenant is confirmed in Chriſt perſonal, not in Chriſt myſtical; hence <hi>Paraeus</hi> concludes it is to be underſtood <hi>individuè de uno Chriſto, ex quo omnis ſpiritualis Benedictio in fideles diffluit.</hi> But this alſo is to be obſerved, That Chriſt is given for <hi>a Covenant of the People,</hi> Iſa. 42. 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Covenant is eſtabliſhed in him, and with him <hi>for all Believers,</hi> who by Union with him, become that <hi>One Seed of Abraham</hi> unto whom <hi>the Bleſſing</hi> of his Covenant doth belong; And ſo in this ſence it as ſtrongly concludes for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only by Faith in Chriſt, as in the other. And for the order of the Words, it need not ſeem ſtrange that <hi>Abraham</hi> is firſt mentioned, and then Chriſt his Seed; for beſides that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes chiefly intended, the firſt ſaith <hi>in thee,</hi> and that given afterwards, <hi>in thy Seed ſhall all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be bleſſed</hi> (which is the order the Apoſtle obſerves.) This is alſo to be conſidered, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was really the <hi>Father of Chriſt according to the Fleſh,</hi> and by Covenant appointed ſo to be, as was <hi>David</hi> alſo; and yet Chriſt is not only the <hi>Offspring,</hi> but alſo <hi>the Root</hi> both of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> And altho' the Mercies of the Covenant, are called <hi>the ſure Mercies</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe of the Covenant which God made with him; yet are they all <hi>originally</hi> from Chriſt in one reſpect, tho' <hi>mediately</hi> by Chriſt in another, as they flow from
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64928:46"/> a Covenant firſt made with <hi>David,</hi> which was to be after ratified and fulfilled in Chriſt the Son of <hi>David</hi>

               <p>§. 8. Fourthly, This Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> as <hi>a Root</hi> of Covenant-Bleſſings, and <hi>common Parent</hi> unto all true Believers: Indeed <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf obtained the Grace of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by Chriſt his Seed, and ſo came into it at the ſecond hand with reſpect to the Son of God who is <hi>the Prince of the Covenant;</hi> but with reſpect unto us, The Covenant was firſt given unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and we are brought into it in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Relation to him as Children, which alſo is by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt: This ſpecial Honour did God put upon <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>the manner</hi> of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Covenant with him, that thenceforth no People ſhould be taken into <hi>Covenant</hi> with himſelf but as <hi>his Seed.</hi> This is evident as to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael after the Fleſh</hi> in the Old Teſtament, that their Covenant-Intereſt was derived from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> and it appears as plainly concerning the ſpiritual Seed and <hi>Iſrael of God</hi> in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>Abraham</hi> is their <hi>Father</hi> Rom. 4. and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64928:47"/> all true Believers are bleſſed in him, as his Seed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 8. &amp; 29. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. for by that Promiſe in <hi>Geneſis, Abraham</hi> was <hi>ordained,</hi> and conſtituted of God the <hi>Father of the faithful,</hi> as hath been before touched: And hence it is that their Fruition of Paradiſe is called a reſting <hi>in Abraham's Boſom, Luk.</hi> 16. becauſe as they have their Entrance into <hi>a State of Grace,</hi> ſo they are alſo brought into the <hi>Kingdom of Glory,</hi> and made to poſſeſs Heaven, as his Children.

               <p>§. 9. Fifthly, The laſt thing I ſhall note is, The eternal Settlement of <hi>the way of Salvation</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Tenour of the Covenant, which is <hi>by Faith in Chriſt:</hi> This is a Covenant that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veye the Grace of Life to poor Sinners by a free and gracious Promiſe; which admits of no other <hi>Reſtipulation</hi> in order to Covenant-Intereſt but <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64928:48"/> the Faithful, and all Believers according to it were to be conſidered as <hi>a Seed</hi> that God would give to him, was confirmed and ratified by a ſure Promiſe unto <hi>Abraham</hi> a conſiderable time <hi>before the Covenant of Circumciſion</hi> was given to him; <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>twenty five Years</hi> before it; and had then no <hi>outward Sign</hi> or Seal annexed thereto; And indeed that which hath been of late affirmed, <hi>That the Covenant of Grace always had an outward Sign on Seal added to it,</hi> is ſo wide a Miſtake, that on the contrary it may be affirmed, That altho' the Efficacy of its Grace did reach Believers in all Ages, yet it was not filled up with Ordinances of Worſhip <hi>proper, and peculiar to it ſelf,</hi> until the times of Reformation; nor had till then any outward Sign or Token <hi>immediately</hi> belonging thereunto; For had it been ſo, this <hi>Sign</hi> or To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as the <hi>Covenant</hi> it ſelf, had remained <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Change,</hi> and not vaniſhed away with the other <hi>Shadows</hi> of the Moſaical Oeconomy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Promiſe made unto <hi>Abraham gives the Seed,</hi> as well as <hi>the Bleſſing</hi> of that Seed unto him; Believers are the <hi>Children of Promiſe</hi> Typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Iſaac</hi> afterwards, being begotten unto God of his own Will by the Efficacy and Grace of his free Promiſe and in the Virtue thereof; yea the <hi>Seed</hi> is firſt ſuppoſed in the Promiſe, and then <hi>the Bleſſing</hi> of that Seed is promiſed, which being <hi>of Grace,</hi> is made <hi>ſure unto all of them,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. And as the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is ſpiritual, ſo is the <hi>Seed</hi> alſo, nor can it be extended farther then to <hi>that Seed</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:64928:48"/> which is the <hi>promiſed Subject</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Sum of all Goſpel bleſſings</hi> being compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>this Promiſe,</hi> it will hence follow, That the proper Heirs of this Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> have a Right (not only in ſome, but) in <hi>all the Promiſes</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant;</hi> and that not in a limited Sence, and as ſuſpended on uncertain Conditions, but in a <hi>full Sence,</hi> and as ſecured by the infinite Grace, Wiſdom, Power, and Faithfulneſs of God, and accordingly they are in time made good to them all.</p>
               <p>And this will be more manifeſt, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that all the Bleſſings of this Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound upon Believers by means of their <hi>

               <p>The <hi>Limitation</hi> therefore of a New Covenant-Intereſt to the Grant of an <hi>external and temporary Priviledg only,</hi> I conceive to be utterly inconſiſtent with the <hi>Promiſes of the Covenant it ſelf;</hi> even ſuch as theſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 13. chap. 59. 21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, 34. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. and many others of like import; Neither will theſe Texts admit of <hi>another Notion</hi> of late inſiſted on for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Paedo-Baptiſm.</hi> viz.</p>

THE Method before laid down leads us in the next place to inquire after the Promiſes given to <hi>Abraham</hi> for his natural Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring and the Aſſurance of them, which it pleaſed God to give him by Covenant-Tranſactions: And here (as formerly) I ſhall diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the Hiſtory that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote of theſe things by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, and comparing the Promiſes made, with the Records of their Accompliſhment in other parts of holy Writ, indeavour to collect from both, the true Import and Extent of them, with the proper Nature and Ends of that Covenant, unto which in a peculiar manner they do belong. Only this I ſhall premit to the whole,</p>
               <p>That theſe Promiſes were not all made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> at one time, Nor the Covenant of them perfected by one Tranſaction, but they were given forth by ſeveral Parts and Degrees, until
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64928:52"/> at laſt the whole <hi>Charter</hi> of Priviledges and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings granted to the natural Offspring of <hi>Abraham</hi> was fairly drawn, and the Covenant of them ſealed by Circumciſion: This will immediately appear in the hiſtorical Account we ſhall have of theſe things; and ſome Regard hereunto may be alſo remarked in the Progreſſion of <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Diſcourſe when he gives a Recapitulation of them. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>§. 2. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2. we find, That when the God of Glory firſt appeared unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and called him out from his own Country, from his Kindred and from his Fathers Houſe, beſides the Promiſe of ſpiritual Bleſſings that was given to him both for himſelf and his ſpiritual Seed, he had alſo the Promiſe of a numerous Offspring which ſhould naturally deſcend from him: No leſs can be intended in theſe Words, <hi>I will make of thee a great Nation,</hi> than this; Thou ſhalt be the Father of a great Nation which ſhall ſpring, and iſſue from thy Loyns: ſuch is the plain Sence of the like Words to <hi>Moſes Num.</hi> 14. 12.

               <p>§. 3. When <hi>Abraham</hi> came into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> unto the Place of <hi>Sichem</hi> the plain of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reh</hi> (the Progeny of curſed <hi>Canaan</hi> being then the Inhabitants of the Country) the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto him again, and gave him a full and expreſs Promiſe of that Land (which for Pleaſantneſs and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 6, 7.</note> Fertility was the Glory of all Lands) for an Inheritance unto his Seed; And there he firſt built <hi>an Altar</hi> unto the Lord, that by worſhipping him he might teſtifie his Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the Promiſe ſo freely given to him, and alſo receive a Ratification of it in the Blood of his accepted Sacrifice. Soon after this a Famine drives <hi>Abraham</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and there <hi>Sarai</hi>'s Chaſtity was indangered by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, but the <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 17. Pſal, 105. 13, 14, 15.</note> Lord's rebuke upon him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Servant from that Affliction; and by his good Providence he was again brought back in Peace to the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> All this time <hi>Lot, Abraham</hi>'s Brothers Son was with him; but now their Subſtance being increaſed and ſome Contention happening between their Servants <hi>Abraham,</hi> to take up the preſent Controverſie
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64928:53"/> and prevent the like, makes a Propoſal for their parting the one from the other, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by <hi>Lot; Gen.</hi> 13. And after that <hi>Lot</hi> was ſeparated from <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Lord again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and confirms the Promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to him, and of the great Increaſe of his Seed that ſhould poſſeſs it, with a ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>walk thro' it in the Length thereof, and the Breadth thereof,</hi> to ſurvey, and by Faith to take Poſſeſſion of it; while as yet he was a Stranger and had no Inheritance in it; no not ſo much as to ſet his Foot on. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>§. 4. In the Promiſe thus renewed there are two things that require ſome farther Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Conveyance of this Inheritance is directly made firſt unto <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, and then, unto his Seed; <hi>All the Land which thou ſeeſt to thee will I give it, and to thy Seed,</hi> Gen. 13. 15. Now it is evident, <hi>Abraham</hi> had no Poſſeſſion in it all his Days, ſave that of a Burying-place which he after purchaſed for his Money paid to the full value thereof; <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. And like was the Caſe alſo of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who were the Heirs of this Promiſe together with <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 11. 9. A Queſtion therefore ariſeth, How was this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſemade good to <hi>Abraham?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Anſwer hereunto (waving at preſent the Typical Reſpect of the promiſed Land, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Inheritance of the ſpiritual and heavenly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64928:54"/> Bleſſings ſignified thereby) obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as to thoſe Words <hi>to thee, and to thy Seed,</hi> the latter may be taken as an Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former, and then the ſence is, <hi>to thee, that is, to thy Seed:</hi> The Hebrew Particle here uſed, is undoubtedly to be taken in this ſence in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">See <hi>Ainſw.</hi> Annot.</note> places, and is to be interpreted not as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulative by <hi>And,</hi> but as explicative by <hi>Even,</hi> or <hi>that is,</hi> See 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 12. where it is ſo rendred; And the like Interpretation muſt be given of it in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 12. <hi>Of him and</hi> (rather <hi>that is) of all the Men that are with him there ſhall not be left ſo much as one.</hi> Now this rendring removes all appearance of Difficulty from the Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Man may have <hi>jus ad rem</hi> that hath not <hi>jus in re;</hi> All Right, is not perſently actionable, but a Man may have a Right to an Inheritance by Promiſe or otherwiſe, without the <hi>Right of preſent Poſſeſſion,</hi> which he may not enter upon till a long time after, or perhaps not himſelf, but his Poſterity are to be poſſeſſed of it by that <hi>Right</hi> which is at preſent made over to him; Neither doth the annexing ſuch Terms render the Promiſe vain or fruitleſs unto him that firſt receives it; for the Aſſurance that the Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhall in its time certainly redound upon his Offspring, is a preſent Comfort to himſelf, as it is an Honour alſo for him this way to be made capable of tranſmitting ſuch a Right to them. And therefore it was a pleaſing Thought to old
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64928:54"/> 
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> when he lay dying, <hi>That God would ſurely viſit his Children and bring them up out of</hi> Egypt <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the promiſed Land; Gen.</hi> 48. 5, 20, 21. tho' he went to his Fathers without ſight of its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment: As it was alſo a ſpecial Favour to <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeth,</hi> that by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Bleſſing each of them obtained a Right in <hi>Canaan</hi> equal with the Brethren of their Father, and yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enjoyed not the temporal Good of that Bleſſing, but their Poſterity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. And indeed, that <note place="margin">

                  </note> is properly ſaid to be given to Parents which is given to their Poſterity upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Promiſe which they have received, and which makes them the Heads of that Covenant-Bleſſing which deſcends upon their Offspring. And that the Fathers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Promiſe in this ſence, is put beyond doubt, by the expreſs Limitation of the time of its Accompliſhment in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13, 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The other Difficulty ariſeth from the Extent of the Pomiſe in point of time; for here God promiſeth to give this Land to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed <hi>for ever,</hi> and again <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. <hi>for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion;</hi> whereas it is evident they have now for many Ages been diſinherited of it. But the Solution of this Doubt will be eaſie to him that conſults the Uſe of theſe Terms in other Texts, and the neceſſary Reſtriction of their Sence when applyed to the State or Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64928:55"/> of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> For the Prieſthood of <hi>Levi</hi> is called <hi>an everlaſting Prieſthood</hi> Num. 25. 13. and the Gates of the Temple <hi>everlaſting Doors</hi> Pſal. 24. 6. and this in the ſame ſence, as <hi>Canaan,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>an everlaſting Inheritance;</hi> no more being intended than the Continuance of theſe for a long time, <hi>viz.</hi> throughout the Old Teſtament Oeconomy, until the days of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> commonly ſpoken of by the Jews under the Notion of <hi>the World to come;</hi> wherein a new State of things was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and when their old Covenant Right and Priviledge was to expire, as having its proper End and Degſin now fully accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>§. 5. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. we have an account of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolemn Tranſaction of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherein (beſides other things included and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt) the Promiſes before given to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning his carnal Seed and their Inheritance, are renewed, and farther explained in diverſe Particulars. And <hi>Abraham</hi> being now more ſtricken in years than when he firſt received the Promiſe, and as yet having no Son, tho' his eternal Happineſs, as well as other Bleſſings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Seed that ſhould be given to him, he was now brought to a greater Tryal of his Faith then formerly; and the preſent acting of it being rendred the more Illuſtrious by the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties it overcame, the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed in this Place to give an expreſs Teſtimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64928:55"/> 
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>He believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And <note place="margin">Conf. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> this is the firſt time that either <hi>Believing</hi> or the <hi>Imputation of Righteouſneſs</hi> is <hi>in terminis</hi> mentioned in the Scripture; Not but that both theſe were true of <hi>Abraham</hi> before, even from the firſt giving out of the Promiſe to him <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. He then believed in the Lord; <hi>and he accounted it to him for Righteouſneſs;</hi> but as his Faith was now manifeſted in a higher Degree, ſo it pleaſed God from this time to leave upon Record a more particular <hi>Encomium</hi> thereof than formerly. And as a farther Token of Favour, immediately hereupon follows that <hi>Explication</hi> and <hi>Inlargement</hi> of the Promiſe to his natural Offspring that was before mentioned. Many things I ſhall paſs over, and only note here theſe few that follow, as direct to my preſent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord informs <hi>Abraham</hi> of the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſhould befall his Poſterity, and the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Death</hi> that ſhould be upon the Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were brought into the Inheritance of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> And alſo particularly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the time thereof; they ſhould be afflicted <hi>four hundred Years,</hi> the Account of which (I ſuppoſe) muſt take its Riſe from the mocking of <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Heir of the Promiſe by <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Son of <hi>Hagar</hi> the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> from which to the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from their Bondage in <hi>Egypt</hi> is exacty four hundred Years.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:64928:56"/>2. The Lord gives <hi>Abraham</hi> an Aſſurance that in the appointed time he will redeem them from their Servitude, and that by ſignal Judgments upon their Oppreſſors, and ſo great Favour to them, as ſhould ſuddenly change their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Want and Penury, to the Enjoyment of great Riches and Subſtance: <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 14. And as for <hi>Abraham;</hi> himſelf ſhould go to his Fathers in Peace, and be buryed in a good old Age; and in the fourth Generation the Bleſſing of this Promiſe ſhould certainly come upon his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. The exact Accompliſhment of all this you may read in the Book of <hi>Exodus;</hi> all the Wonders there recorded being the Birth of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 17.</note> for it was not the Goodneſs of the People, but the Stability of the Promiſe that all thoſe things are to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Reaſon is given for the referring of the Accompliſhment of the Promiſe to this time; Becauſe the Nations whoſe Land they were to poſſeſs were not yet <hi>ripe for Judgment;</hi> and the Meaſure of their Iniquity muſt be filled up before the Curſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> was fully executed upon them. Thus we ſee, that although the Children of <hi>Canaan</hi> bare his Curſe many Generations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, yet this Curſe deſcended not upon them without a full Meaſure of their own Sin; as there is no doubt but <hi>Canaan</hi>'s partnerſhip with <hi>Cham</hi> in his Wickedneſs did at firſt bring the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64928:56"/> Curſe of his Father upon himſelf. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe things are expreſly ſaid to have been tranſacted in a way of <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> and alſo the Bounds of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are ſet, and thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions marked out by Name <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 18, 19, 20, 21.</note> that were to be diſpoſſeſſed and deſtroyed by them.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Before we paſs on farther in the Hiſtory of God's Tranſactions with <hi>Abraham</hi> reſpecting his natural Offspring; Let it be obſerved;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as this Seed was afterwards raiſed up to <hi>Abraham</hi> by virtue of a Promiſe, ſo the firſt Grant of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to them for an Inheritance was by a gratuitous Promiſe alſo; and that Promiſe paſt into the Form of a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> long before the giving of the Law as a Condition of their Inheritance therein, yea before the Inſtitution of Circucmiſion; And the Original of their Claim being from a <hi>free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> the Severity of that Law which afterwards they came under, was ſo far reſtrained thereby, as that (notwithſtanding their manifold Breach of Covenant with God, and Forfeiture of all <hi>legal Claim</hi> of their Rights and Priviledges in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> thereby) they were never utterly cut off from that good Land, nor ceaſed to be a peculiar People unto God, until the <hi>End</hi> of their being <hi>made ſo,</hi> was fully anſwered, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64928:57"/> that Promiſe expired with the Accompliſhment of its Deſign, in the Introduction of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, to the full Enjoyment of thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings, which were the Subſtance of what was but darkly ſhadowed, by their temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This will be of great Uſe in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the Typical State of that People, which I ſhall not now inlarge upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hitherto it is not <hi>expreſly</hi> ſignified, That <hi>Sarai</hi> ſhall be the Mother of this Seed; And therefore in the delay of the Promiſe, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarai</hi> (not knowing but it might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that way) agreed about <hi>Abraham</hi>'s going in to <hi>Hagar</hi> the Hand-maid of <hi>Sarai,</hi> that by her they might obtain Children; <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. It will be granted that on good grounds they might have other Apprehenſions of the Promiſe before (as it will appear they had, by Conference of <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.) and that this proceeded from ſome Vacillation, and weakneſs of Faith in them; but yet it was not ſuch as did <hi>directly</hi> croſs, and call into Queſtion the Promiſes before given; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any thing appear to the contrary but that <hi>Abraham</hi> accounted of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> as <hi>Heir of the Promiſe,</hi> until the Lord appeared to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and fully compleated his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him about his natural Offspring.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Much leſs was there as yet any Intimation given of a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> to be made, in point of Priviledge or Covenant-Right, betwixt the Children that might in one way or another be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64928:57"/> brought forth unto <hi>Abraham:</hi> But the Claim of ſuch (ſupoſing, as it after proved, that there might be many) ſeemed to be equal; until the farther ſtating thereof <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Neither was there as yet any diſtinguiſhing Character appointed for his Seed as a Foundation for their riſing up into ſuch <hi>a Church-State,</hi> as that the ſolemn Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divine Service ſhould be appropriate to them, and none accounted Members of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church but themſelves, and ſuch as became <hi>Proſelites</hi> to them. Tho' its true all that hath been before mentioned, was diſpoſed in order hereunto, being in the wife Counſel of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards ſuch an End; for known unto him are all his Works, from the Beginning; And therefore the <hi>former Promiſes</hi> are ſtill recollected, and taken in, in the <hi>after Tranſactions</hi> about this People.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Promiſes hitherto given unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for his natural Offspring, do as much concern them in <hi>remote Generations,</hi> as in an <hi>immediate Deſcent</hi> from him; nay in ſome Reſpects were more fully made good unto them than the other; for it was not until the <hi>fourth Generation</hi> that God <hi>was known to them by his Name JEHOVAH,</hi> Exod. 6. in the actual Accompliſhing of his Word; the <hi>Fathers</hi> having only his <hi>Alſufficiency</hi> ingaged for the <hi>after fulfilling</hi> of the Promiſe in its proper Seaſon. It was not <hi>Abraham's imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,</hi> but his <hi>mediate Seed</hi> that became numerous <hi>as the Duſt of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>took Poſſeſſion</hi> of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64928:58"/> the Land flowing with Milk and Hony.</p>
               <p>§. 7. We ſhall now paſs on to <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. And what is there more largely recorded, we have briefly pointed at by <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>phen</hi> in his general view of the Hiſtory of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Act. 7. 8. <hi>And he gave him the Covenant of Circumciſion; And ſo</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>begat</hi> Iſaac <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By <hi>the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> we are to underſtand that Covenant of which Circumciſion was <hi>the Sign</hi> or <hi>Token;</hi> or that Covenant in which a <hi>Reſtipulation</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Obſervation of <hi>this Rite</hi> or <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, That in this Tranſaction of God with <hi>Abraham</hi> we firſt meet with an <hi>expreſs</hi> Injunction of <hi>Obedience to a Command</hi> (and that of <hi>poſitive</hi> Right) as the <hi>Condition</hi> of Covenant-Intereſt; And the whole is uſhered in with this Prologue <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>I am the Almighty God; walk before me and be thou perfect.</hi> In which Words, firſt the <hi>Alſufficiency</hi> of God is revealed for the <hi>Enſurance</hi> of the Promiſes; and then a <hi>ſtrict and intire Obedience</hi> to his Precepts is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in order to the Inheritance of the good things that were to be given by this Covenant; And in <hi>this Mode</hi> of tranſacting it, the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to draw the firſt Lines of that Form of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Relation, which the natural Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> were fully ſtated in by the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> which was a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and its Condition or Terms, <hi>Do this and live.</hi> For altho' the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64928:58"/> of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> hath in all Reſpects (as well in point of time, as Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) the <hi>Precedence</hi> to the Covenant made with his carnal Seed in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Line; yet in the wiſe Counſel of God things were ſo ordered, That the <hi>full Revelation</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, the <hi>actual</hi> Accompliſhment of the great Promiſes thereof, and its being <hi>filled up</hi> with Ordinances proper thereunto, ſhould <hi>ſucceed</hi> the Covenant made with <hi>Iſrael after the Fleſh,</hi> And take place upon the Diſſiolution thereof when it <hi>waxed old and vaniſhed away.</hi> And therefore the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Intereſt of the natural Seed, was to be perfected by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> before the <hi>Goſpel preached unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>was unveiled;</hi> and accordingly this Chapter leads us on a great Step towards the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> and the Terms thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Altho' this Covenant of Circumciſion do properly and immediately belong to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and is ordered as a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that Oeconomy</hi> which they were to be brought under <hi>until the times of Reformation;</hi> yet by way of Preface thereunto you have (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 4, 5.) a Recapitulation of former Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and a renewed Confirmation of one great Promiſe of the Covenant of Grace before given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. <hi>A Father of many Nations have I made thee;</hi> That this is principally to be underſtood of his believing Seed, collected out of all Nations indifferently, appears from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64928:59"/> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. And that <hi>Abraham</hi> was conſtituted the <hi>Father of the faithful</hi> before this Covenant of Circumciſion was made, and did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Grant of this Priviledg thereby, hath been before proved from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hiſtory, and is alſo argued by the Apoſtle ſtrongly in the former part of that forementioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, That it ſhould be thus repeated in this place, there is very great reaſon, upon a twofold Account;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it might be evident; that <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Peculiarity</hi> with the carnal Seed, which was firſt to take place, and that Wall of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which was to be raiſed up betwixt them and other Nations (the corner Stone of which was now to be laid in Circumciſion) ſhould not <hi>evacuate,</hi> or <hi>intrench upon</hi> the Covenant of Grace, or the <hi>Right</hi> and Priviledg of the ſpiritual Seed ſtated therein, or of any part of it; but was <hi>added,</hi> and made <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the great Ends thereof: The Springs of New-Covenant-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which God had before opened to all Nations were not to be ſhut up again by this Covenant; nor the Heathen <note n="*" place="margin">Read diligently <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</note> excluded; from inheriting the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> thro' Faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by any Priviledg or Right conferred upon the Jew: And therefore when the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion was given to the carnal Seed, in order to a full Separation of them from other Nations, It pleaſed God, therewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive

               <p>That there is no way of avoiding Confuſion and Intanglements, in our Conception of theſe things, but by keeping before our Eyes the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Abraham's Seed,</hi> which is either <hi>ſpiritual</hi> or <hi>carnal,</hi> and of the Promiſes reſpectively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to either: For this whole Covenant of Circumciſion, as given to the carnal Seed, can no more convey ſpiritual and eternal Bleſſings to them as ſuch, then it can now inright a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (tho' a Child of <hi>Abraham)</hi> in their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and typical Bleſſings in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> Neither can I ſee any reaſon for an Aſſignment of Covenant-Intereſt in all ſpiritual Bleſſings typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as well as in the temporal Bleſſings that were the Types of them, to the carnal Seed; and yet not to admit the Conveyance of the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to hold good in point of temporal Bleſſings, to the ſpiritual Seed; ſeeing (as ſome conceive) both are directly included in the ſame Covenant; and the Promiſe of both was ſealed with the ſame Seal.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:64928:60"/>
               <p>But the Truth is, Notwithſtanding <hi>the reſpect</hi> this Covenant hath to the Covenant of Grace, it yet remains <hi>diſtinct</hi> from it; and can give no more then <hi>external and typical Bleſſings unto a typical Seed:</hi> The ſtating of their Rights and Priviledges, in <hi>Subſerviency,</hi> and with a <hi>typical Reſpect,</hi> to the Diſpenſation of Grace to the Elect, in the New-Covenant, is the proper End, and Deſign of this Tranſaction in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. as will more fully appear in the particular Account of the Promiſes given therein.</p>
               <p>§. 9. The Sum of thoſe Promiſes is ſet before us in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 6, 7, 8. In the 6th <hi>Verſe;</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a numerous Offspring is repeated in ſuch Terms as do import (if not Inlargement, yet at leaſt) a farther Explication of what was before promiſed in <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>And I will make thy Seed as the Duſt of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. For here the Promiſe runs thus; <hi>I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make Nations of thee; and Kings ſhall come out of thee.</hi> Theſe Words in their firſt and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sence had their Accompliſhment in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Offspring of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and are particularly intended of his Seed by <hi>Iſaac;</hi> For tho' it be true that other Nations beſides <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſpring from <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet the Context will evince it to be that Seed with which the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſhould be eſtabliſhed, that is here meant; and that was with the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Iſaac</hi> only. To ſee therefore the fulfilling of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64928:61"/> this Promiſe, we muſt look to the <hi>twelve Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were as ſo many <hi>diſtinct Peoples, and Nations,</hi> with reſpect to their Power and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; tho' with reſpect to Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment united in one Polity, and ſo but one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And to this Promiſe <hi>Jacob</hi> hath an Eye in his bleſſing of the Sons of <hi>Joſeph Gen.</hi> 48. 19. where he ſaith that <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> (the Father of one of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael) ſhall be a People, and ſhall become great: i. e.</hi> His Seed ſhall be nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſtrong, and ſhall make up <hi>one People, or one of the Nations,</hi> that God had promiſed ſhould come of <hi>Abraham;</hi> And yet <hi>Ephraim</hi> his younger Brother muſt have the Preeminence in being the Father of another diſtinct People, or Tribe, that ſhould be ſtronger then <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> and more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; in that his Seed ſhould become <hi>the Fulneſs of Nations</hi> (ſo it is in the <hi>Hebrew)</hi> i. e. a very great Nation and People. That <hi>Diſtinction of Tribes</hi> which was after obſerved among the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> ſeems to be firſt pointed at in theſe Words, <hi>I will make Nations of thee;</hi> And the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words, <hi>viz. Kings ſhall come out of thee;</hi> do not only ſignifie the Eminency of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed in general, but more particularly reſpect their forming under a diſtinct Polity, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their own, or (as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks Chap. 16.) <hi>proſpering into a Kingdom;</hi> and living under the Rule and Conduct of Judges, and Princes raiſed up among themſelves; as they were from <hi>Moſes</hi> his time (who was <hi>King in</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:64928:61"/> Jeſhurum, <hi>when the Heads of the People and the Tribes gathered themſelves together,</hi> Deut. 33. 5.) by whoſe Miniſtry God ſettled their State, and Government, by Laws peculiar to themſelves; and fulfilled the Covenant of their Fathers therein. This Branch of the Promiſe contains more than was expreſly given to <hi>Abraham</hi> before.</p>
               <p>§. 10. In the following Words <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. we have the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of this, and of the enſuing Promiſes alſo, which God gives unto <hi>Abraham</hi> by paſſing them into a ſolemn Covenant, and conſequently, an <hi>Interpoſition of himſelf,</hi> and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of all the Perfections and Properties of his divine Nature, to be exerted for the making of them good: Thus you read; <hi>And I will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my Covenant between me and thee; and thy Seed after thee in their Generations; for an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this is added the Promiſe of their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. <hi>And I will give unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a Stranger, all the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion; and I will he thire God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Difficulty ariſing from thoſe Terms in the Promiſe which give the Right of the Inheritance of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the firſt place, hath been already conſidered and cleared; as alſo how <hi>the Land of Canaan</hi> may be ſaid to be an <hi>everlaſting Poſſeſſion:</hi> And in the ſame fence is <hi>this Covenant</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:64928:62"/> ſaid to be <hi>everlaſting: Iſrael</hi> could not be finally cut off from the promiſed Inheritance, until the Covenant it ſelf, by which it was given to them did expire: As was, therefore, the Duration of the Inheritance, and of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Right therein, ſo was the Duration of this Covenant, <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> not abſolutely, but with ſuch a Limitation as the Nature of the things ſpoken of doth neceſſarily require, and as is uſual in thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of things pertaining to the Jewiſh State. There is therefore, no more Reaſon to conclude from <hi>this Term,</hi> That the Covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was directly and properly a Covenant of ſpiritual and eternal Bleſſings, than there is to affirm that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and the good things thereof, were a ſpiritual and eternal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Howbeit, From the ſtrict Connexion of this 7th <hi>Verſe</hi> with the <hi>6th,</hi> and the Aſſurance here given that <hi>God will eſtabliſh his Covenant with the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>to be their God;</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s carnal Seed, and the <hi>Grandeur of their civil State,</hi> is not all that is promiſed in this Covenant, nor yet the principal Bleſſing beſtowed on them therein; but rather, <hi>The forming of them into a Church-State,</hi> with the Eſtabliſhment of the Ordinances of publick Worſhip among them, wherein they ſhould walk in a Covenant-Relation to God, as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64928:62"/> his peculiar People (underſtand it ſtill of the old Covenant, whereing they had their peculiar Right and Priviledg) No leſs can be intended in this, <hi>I will be a God unto them in their Generations;</hi> And it is alſo made more evident by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account that is given of this Tranſaction with reſpect to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> Gen. 17. 18-21.</p>
               <p>When the Lord had promiſed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> a Son by <hi>Sarah,</hi> whoſe Name ſhould be called <hi>Iſaac;</hi> he thus prays for <hi>Iſhmael, O that</hi> Iſhmael <hi>might live before thee!</hi> which the <hi>Chaldee</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſeth thus, <hi>might live, and Worſhip before thee:</hi> No doubt his Prayer was, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> might alſo be an Heir of the Bleſſing of this Covenant; But that was not granted to him; for the Lord would have <hi>his Covenant Seed called in</hi> Iſaac <hi>only:</hi> with him God would eſtabliſh his Covenant, having appointed and choſen him alone to be the Heir thereof, who was to be a Child of Promiſe, and Son of the Free-Woman: And yet for <hi>Iſhmael</hi> (in ſpecial Favour to <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe Seed he was) thus much is obtained, that he ſhould be made fruitful, and multiplyed exceedingly; twelve Princes, or Heads of great Families, ſhould ſpring of him (which imports ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy to the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, whoſe old Covenant-State was typified in <hi>Iſhmael)</hi> and God would make him a <hi>great Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> And yet all this lay ſhort of the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Offspring by <hi>Iſaac;</hi> from
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64928:63"/> which <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was <hi>now excluded;</hi> It is plain therefore, that the <hi>Priviledg</hi> of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> as well as the <hi>flouriſhing</hi> of the <hi>Civil State</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ariſe unto them out of the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
               <p>The like may be obſerved of <hi>Eſau</hi> afterwards, whom the Lord rejected before he was born; excluding him from the Priviledg and Bleſſing of this Covenant, which deſcended upon <hi>Jacob only:</hi> And yet <hi>Eſau</hi> was alſo the Father of a great Nation, and of many Kings, and had the Inheritance of many outward Bleſſings aſſigned to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 39.</p>
               <p>We conclude therefore, That notwithſtanding the carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> could not, as ſuch, claim a Right in the ſpiritual and eternal Bleſſings of the New-Covenant, becauſe of their Intereſt in the Covenant of Circumciſion; yet their <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> in their Church-State, tho' immediately conſiſting in things outward and typical, were of far greater Value and Uſe, than any meer worldly, or earthly Bleſſing; as giving them choyce means of the Knowledg of God; and ſetting them <hi>nearer to him</hi> than any Nation in the World beſides.</p>

               <p>§. 1. THoſe Paſſages in <hi>Geneſis</hi> that have been laſt diſcourſed of, give me an Occaſion of Inlargement upon ſome things, which as they are deduced from the Texts that have been in part conſidered already; ſo the farther clearing and ſtrengthening of them, will not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64928:64"/> what hath been already hinted, but alſo contribute very much to the right Underſtanding of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of this Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion that I am treating of; and to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Grounds of many <hi>miſtaken Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> from it, by thoſe that would from thence determine the right <hi>Subjects of Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What I intend, is ſumm'd up in theſe two Propoſitions;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <q rend="margQuotes">The <hi>mediate and remote Seed</hi> of that Line to which the Promiſes of the Covenant of Circumciſion did belong, were as fully inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and intereſted in them, as the <hi>immediate Seed.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <q rend="margQuotes">From the firſt eſtabliſhing of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſome of the <hi>immediate Seed of Abraham</hi> were <hi>excluded</hi> from Intereſt in it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. I ſhall begin with the Firſt: The Truth of which appears ſufficiently in the <hi>expreſs Terms</hi> of the Promiſes now given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which run to him, and to <hi>his Seed after him in their Generations;</hi> and the Covenant it ſelf is ſaid to be an <hi>everlaſting Covenant,</hi> which they are ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded to keep <hi>in their Generations;</hi> Gen. 17. 7, 9, 13. Theſe Terms are uſed, becauſe it was a Covenant in force, as well for the Benefit of <hi>more remote,</hi> as <hi>nearer Generations;</hi> Its <hi>Promiſes</hi> did include, and its <hi>Law</hi> did equally bind both, during the whole State of the <hi>Moſaical Oeconomy.</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:64928:65"/> The <hi>Right</hi> of the remoteſt Generation, was as much derived from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Covenant made with him, as that of his immediate Seed was; and did not at all depend upon the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their immediate Parents:</hi> And therefore the immediate Seed of thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that fell in the Wilderneſs under the Diſpleaſure of God, were made to inherit the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> by virtue of this Covenant with <hi>Abraham;</hi> who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe could never have injoyed it by virtue of their <hi>immediate Parents Stedfaſtneſs</hi> in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>§ 3. I ſuppoſe it cannot be denyed but <hi>groſs Idolatry,</hi> was a manifeſt and full Breach of this Covenant, on the part of the <hi>Idolater;</hi> And yet when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s time became guilty of the vileſt Idolatries, the Lord ſtill claims an Intereſt in their Children by virtue of this Covenant: <hi>Eezek</hi> 16. 20. 21. <hi>Moreover thou haſt taken thy Sons and thy Daughters, whom thou haſt born unto me, and theſe haſt thou ſacrificed unto them to be devoured: Is this of thy Whoredoms a ſmall matter, that thou haſt ſlam my Children,</hi> &amp;c. The Children of an Apoſtatize <hi>Iſraelite</hi> were God's as well as thoſe of his faithful Servants; which could not have been, if their Covenant-Intereſt had been ſuſpended on the good abearing of immediate Parents.</p>
               <p>And to this agrees the Story that we have of <hi>Mattathias</hi> his proceeding in the Reformation of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64928:65"/> the Church in his day; who, finding that many had denyed their God, and forſaken his true Worſhip, in that time of Perſecution, did (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of <hi>Moſes)</hi> execute Juſtice upon as many of the Apoſtates as he could lay Hands on, by ſlaying them; (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth) but the Children that he found to be left uncircumciſed in this Time of Apoſtacy, he took and circumciſed them: The Words of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 2. 46. are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This I know hath no farther Strength than of an <hi>humane Teſtimony;</hi> But it ſpeaks fully what the ſence of thoſe Times was concerning the Covenant-Intereſt of Children; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apoſtacy of their <hi>immediate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> could not prejudice it, ſo as to render them uncapable of Circumciſion; which ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes their Covenant-Right to be derived from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not ſuſpended upon <hi>them.</hi> And <hi>Mattathias</hi> who did this, was not only a Man zealous for the Law, but alſo one that may be preſumed to have underſtood it better than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, ſeeing he was a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And not only the Paſſages before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtted on, but the whole Current of Scripture, where theſe things are mentioned, runs very ſmoothly this way; but eſpecially that Phraſe before touched <hi>[thy Seed in their Generations]</hi> will admit no other Sence; being by no means
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64928:66"/> capable of a reſtraint to the immediate Seed, but even as the like Expreſſion <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 12. ſecures <hi>Noah</hi>'s Children from drowning, by the Waters of an univerſal Deluge, to the end of the World; ſo did this Promiſe give a Covenant-Intereſt to the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> till the times of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>We exclude not the immediate Seed, <hi>viz. Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi> but the Promiſe paſſeth on much farther, and is to be fulfilled in <hi>a Seed multiplyed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,</hi> and formed into <hi>a Kingdom,</hi> which it was not until <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and his immediate Offspring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, were laid in the Duſt.</p>
               <p>Moreover; The Inheritance promiſed in the <hi>Land of Canaan,</hi> is given to <hi>this Seed</hi> for an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Poſſeſſion;</hi> which was fulfilled in their <hi>ſucceſſive inheriting</hi> of it from Generation to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; therefore the Seed intended was ſuch as ſhould be propagated thro' many Generations, the laſt of which are as directly here ſpoken of as the firſt; Circumciſion being to be obſerved by them (upon the account of the Promiſe, and Command now given) <hi>for an everlaſting Covenant:</hi> 
                  <q rend="margQuotes">The Relation of the carnal Seed, to God, in an external, typical Covenant; the Inheritance of <hi>Canaan</hi> by virtue thereof; and the Seal of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; are all of one Date, and did all expire together.</q>
               </p>

               <p>I do not ſay, that their Church-State was <hi>exactly,</hi> and <hi>compleatly formed</hi> by this Ordinance <hi>alone;</hi> But this I intend; That in the Covenant of Circumciſion were contained the <hi>firſt Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>that in the Wilderneſs;</hi> and the latter was the filling up, and compleating of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; yea it was made with them <hi>in Purſuance of it;</hi> and for the full Accompliſhment of the Promiſes now made to <hi>Abraham;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Priviledge of the carnal Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> by virtue of the Covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, can riſe no higher than the Advantage, and Priviledg of a Jew, by virtue of the Covenant in the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>§. 6. For the Confirmation of this, I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Circumciſion was the <hi>Entrance into,</hi> and <hi>Boundary of Communion</hi> in the Jewiſh Church; and it was made ſo by the expreſs Command of God himſelf; who ſtraightly injoyned, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever brake the Covenant by the neglect of Circumciſion; ſhould be <hi>cut off from his People:</hi> Gen. 17. 14. And as it was to them <hi>a Gate of Priviledg,</hi> ſo was it no leſs <hi>a Bond of Duty;</hi> not only obliging them to obey the Will of God ſo far as it was now made known to <hi>Abraham;</hi> but alſo, to the Obſervation of all thoſe Laws
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64928:67"/> and Ordinances that were after delivered to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> when ſo delivered: For the circumciſed Perſon was <hi>a Debtor to keep the whole Law:</hi> Gal. 5. 3. And this Obligation did reſult from its <hi>proper <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and End,</hi> in its <hi>primitive Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;</hi> for we read not of its Appointment to any <hi>new End</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor of any <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> it was aſſigned to, <hi>de novo,</hi> which it had not (at leaſt virtually) from its <hi>firſt Appointment:</hi> It was from firſt to laſt, a <hi>viſible Character</hi> upon this People as ſeparated unto God from other Nations, and as ſuch they made their Boaſt of it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be concluded to belong unto that Covenant, from which all their Rights, and Priviledges, as ſuch a People, did ſpring; and where <hi>the Sign</hi> was not <hi>varied,</hi> there was no eſſential Variation, or <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>Covenant</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Secondly, All the Advantage, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, is in the New Teſtament, expreſly referred to the Covenant of Circumciſion; For thus the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks by <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 3. 1. <hi>What Advantage then hath the Jew? Or what Profit is there of Circumciſion?</hi> You ſee theſe Phraſes; <hi>[The Advantage of the Jew]</hi> and <hi>[The Profit of Circumciſion]</hi> are ſet down as <hi>Convertible;</hi> they import the ſame thing; what belongs to the one, belongs to the other: And wherever Circumciſion is mentioned in the New-Teſtament, it is ſpoken of as no leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64928:67"/> to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy (tho' the firſt Inſtitution was not of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of the Fathers) than any other part of the Law firſt given by him; and boaſting in Circumciſion is eſteemed a boaſting in the Fleſh, as much as boaſting in any other Old-Teſtament Priviledg of the Jew; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. From all which we may ſafely conclude, that the <hi>Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> was of the <hi>ſame Kind</hi> with the <hi>Levitical Covenant,</hi> afterwards annexed to it, or rather built upon it, for the full accompliſhing of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</p>
               <p>I might alſo inſiſt upon <hi>Levi's paying Tithes in Abraham;</hi> which could not have been reckoned to him, if he had not been in <hi>Abraham</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as an Head in ſome Covenant Tranſaction, wherein <hi>Levi</hi> was Covenanted for, by <hi>Abraham:</hi> Neither could this have been pleaded by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle as it is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9, 10. if that Covenant in which the <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſthood was founded, and to which it did belong, had not been originally made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> But I paſs this.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Thirdly, The Scriptures do every where affirm, That the Lord brought up <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> formed their Church-State by eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Order of his ſolemn Worſhip among them, and gave them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in Poſſeſſion, in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of his Covenant with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and for the fulfilling of the Promiſes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64928:68"/> thereof: For Inſtance let theſe Places be well weighed; <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 24, 25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10,—13. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 7, 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 78. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. And herein was he known to them by <hi>his Name JEHOVAH,</hi> as giving Being to his Promiſe in the actual Accompliſhment of it, which their Fathers did depend upon <hi>his Alſufficiency</hi> for: Conf. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Thus if we follow the Clue of Scripture in our Enquiries after the Original of the Covenant of Peculiarity made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, it will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guide us to that Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> for his natural Offspring, and ſealed by Circumciſion. And yet that <hi>Covenant of Peculiarity</hi> is in the New Teſtament always ſtyled <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>Carnal;</hi> a Covenant from which the <hi>Goſpel Covenant</hi> is <hi>diſtinguiſhed;</hi> and to which it is <hi>in many Reſpects oppoſed:</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31,—34. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8,—13.</p>
               <p>Neither doth there lye any juſt Exception againſt what hath been ſaid, from the <hi>Inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Terms and Articles</hi> of this Covenant in the <hi>Conſummation</hi> thereof in the Wilderneſs; for that will not in the leaſt infer any ſubſtantial Difference of this Covenant from the Covenant of Circumciſion; ſeeing it is no more than God hath done by the Goſpel, with reſpect to the New-Covenant that was confirmed in Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham;</hi> which being firſt ſummed up in one Promiſe, <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed,</hi> was abundantly inlarged, cleared, filled up with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64928:68"/> its own Ordinances, and made the intire Rule of the Church's Obedience, when the <hi>Fulneſs of Time</hi> came which that Promiſe had reſpect to; And yet the New Teſtament is not another Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel differing from that preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or another Covenant differing from that before confirmed of God in Chriſt; In like manner the <hi>filling up</hi> of this Covenant of Circumciſion was reſerved to the time of God's performing what he now promiſed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> without the leaſt change of the Nature or Deſign of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it ſelf.</p>
               <p>§. 9. We come now to the ſecond Propoſition: <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q rend="margQuotes">That from the firſt Eſtabliſhment of this Covenant, ſome of the immediate Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> were excluded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Promiſes thereof did belong to <hi>Iſaac's Line</hi> in their Generations, from Age to Age; but they did not appertain to the immediate Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Hagar</hi> or by <hi>Keturah;</hi> Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent being reſtrained by the expreſs Caution of God himſelf, to whom it belonged to ſet the Bounds of this Covenant-Relation and Intereſt, and that in the very firſt making of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion with <hi>Abraham:</hi> Read dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 19, 20, 21. <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy Seed be called;</hi> It was <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Seed and not <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s that the Lord would ſet apart for himſelf, and would give the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> unto, and eſtabliſh his ſolemn Worſhip among them, to be a God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  </gap>ovenant of Grace, when he begat the one as when he begat the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, That <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was at firſt included, and intereſted in the Covenant, but was afterwards rejected and caſt out for his prophane mocking at <hi>Iſaac:</hi> It will be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</p>
               <p>That ſuch a Suppoſition is againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Words and Letter of the Text before ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Limitation which God the Author of the Covenant made of its Promiſes therein; Before <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was circumciſed God declares that he gave not the Promiſes of his Covenant unto him, but to <hi>Iſaac</hi> with whom it ſhould be eſtabliſhed: So that <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s being caſt out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family afterwards, will in no wiſe infer that till then he was in Covenant; but only thus much, That then it was made more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt than ever, that the Covenant appertained not to him, and that he muſt be concluded under the Exception that was before laid in againſt him. And the divine Confirmation of what <hi>Sarah</hi> then required is grounded upon that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his Will that he now made unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> as will be evident to him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. with Chap. 21. 12, 13. <hi>Caſt out the Bond Woman and her Son, For in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called.</hi> And therfore <hi>Abraham</hi> did
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64928:69"/> afterwards voluntarily ſend his Sons by <hi>Keturah,</hi> far away from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and from the promiſed Land: <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 1,—6. altho' theſe were guilty of no ſuch Wickedneſs as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> who mocked at <hi>Iſaac;</hi> but for ought appears might be very holy and good Men, the true Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by Faith, according to the Tenour of the Covenant of Grace; tho' they might not be Joynt-Heirs with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> according to the Tenour of the Covenant of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>§. 10. It is moreover to be obſerved; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Covenant-Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> was called in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and his immediate Children were only two Sons, <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> yet the Right of this Covenant-Bleſſing did not equally deſcend upon them both, but once more the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains it by the <hi>Rejection of Eſau</hi> and <hi>chooſing of Jacob,</hi> and that before the Children had done either good or evil; That the purpoſe of God according to Election might ſtand; and that he might here ſet before us an awful Type of his Soveraingty in the after Diſpenſation of the Grace of the Goſpel: <hi>Eſau</hi> (indeed) did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the profane ſelling of his Birth-right, and deſpiſing the Inheritance, render himſelf manifeſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy <note place="margin">Conf. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 23. with <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 2, &amp;. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 10,—13.</note> of the Bleſſing; but before this, God had declared that <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Seed, and not <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſhould inherit the Promiſes of this Covenant.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:64928:70"/>
               <p>And poſſibly it may be from hence that <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are ſo particularly mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 8. becauſe of the <hi>ſpecial Limitation</hi> of the Promiſes to them; and becauſe they were <hi>the Seed</hi> brought forth <hi>in the virtue of the Promiſe</hi> given to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. Thus plain do theſe thing lye before us in the Hiſtory of the Scripture, That they will hardly be called into Queſtion, if our minds be not <hi>prepoſſeſt</hi> with ſome particular Notion unto which they are not ſuited: But it is earneſtly pleaded by ſome, <q rend="margQuotes">That all the immediate Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were intereſted in this Covenant, and that the firſt Right in its Promiſe, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them; inaſmuch as the Seal of the Covenant was applyed to them all, in their Circumciſion; the doing of which muſt be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and uſeleſs, if they had not been Parties in that Covenant unto which this Seal did belong.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this, I anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no way meet our uncertain Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or Inferences, ſhould be oppoſed to the expreſs Teſtimony of God himſelf; or that his Wiſdom ſhould be called into Queſtion upon their Account: Now tho' God laid his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> yet at the ſame time he tells him that his Covenant ſhould be eſtabliſhed with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> excluding <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael;</hi> unto whom he will not grant (tho by <hi>Abraham</hi> interceded for) a Joynt-Intereſt with
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64928:70"/> 
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> in this Covenant; but diſmiſſeth his Claim, and lays out his Portion by himſelf, in another inferior Bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Abraham</hi> was as ſtrictly bound to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>all the Males</hi> in his Family, that were bought with his Mony of the Stranger, that was not of his Seed, and the Children of thoſe Bond-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that were born in his Houſe, as he was his own Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12, 13. And this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation remained upon the Heirs of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in their Generations; And yet none of theſe Servants (no nor yet <hi>Iſhmael)</hi> were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made Parties in the Covenant, ſo as that the Promiſes of it ſhould be ſealed unto them, by Circumciſion, as their own Inheritance: And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſuppoſe an Intereſt in the Covenant, without a Right to the Promiſes thereof, is to introduce a meer Chimera or Fancy, inſtead of a real Covenant-Intereſt: Now the Promiſes of this Covenant are, that God will give unto the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> called in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion; and that he will be a God to them in their Generations, and they ſhall be a peculiar People unto him: And can we ſuppoſe that theſe Promiſes did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and to the Bond-Servants in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family? or were they ever made good to them? If not; ſeeing the Performance of theſe Promiſes was the fulfilling of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on God's part, whoſe Faithfulneſs is to all Generations, we muſt conclude they never had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64928:71"/> the Grant of them, or an Intereſt in them: And if the Promiſes of the Covenant did not belong to them, then were they not Parties in Covenant: and if not in Covenant; then they were not circumciſed upon the account of their own Covenant-Intereſt, but in obedience to the particular, and <hi>poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>§. 12. It appears therefore, from what hath been already ſaid; that Circumciſion was a Seal of the Covenant <hi>upon all,</hi> but not <hi>to all,</hi> that were circumciſed; it was a Seal of the Covenant <hi>unto the Children of the Covenant,</hi> and gave them <hi>admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to all the Bleſſings promiſed therein; but it did not make their <hi>Slaves</hi> free of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor was it given for their ſakes; And if they could not claim the <hi>outward Priviledge</hi> of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> thereby, it will hardly be granted that ſingly upon the account of their being bought by a Jew (tho' their Maſter himſelf, perhaps, had no Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace) they ſhould be made the Subjects of a New Covenant-Bleſſing; and that, whether they knew, or were capable of conſenting to the Terms of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or not; For that might be the Caſe of many of them, ſeeing the Law concerned ſuch as were purchaſed in their Infancy, as well as thoſe of riper Years; As well the one as the other <hi>muſt needs be circumciſed,</hi> becauſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given to his Maſter. Perhaps this might belong to the typical Holineſs of the Family of an
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64928:71"/> 
                  <hi>Iſraelite;</hi> but whether we can fully underſtand the Reaſon of it or not; it ſufficeth, that the wiſe God ordained it ſo to be. However this is certain, that it was the <hi>poſitive Command of God,</hi> and not ſimply <hi>Covenant-Intereſt,</hi> that was the Rule according to which Circumciſion was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and by which, both the Subjects, and Circumſtances of it, were determined: And ſo muſt it be in all things of like Nature; For in Matters of <hi>poſitive Right,</hi> we can have no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for our Practice but from a <hi>poſitive Precept:</hi> For things of this kind fall not within the compaſs of <hi>Common Light,</hi> or general Principles of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion; but have their Original from; <hi>a particular, diſtinct, and independent Will of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver:</hi> And therefore Inferences built upon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notions may ſoon lead us into Miſtakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; if upon ſuch Inferences we <hi>form a Rule</hi> to our ſelves of <hi>larger Extent</hi> than the <hi>expreſs Words of the Inſtitution</hi> do warrant.</p>
               <p>§. 13. The Propoſitions laid down, being thus far explained and confirmed; I ſhall draw to a cloſe of this Chapter with an Inference or two, grounded upon the foregoing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that holds himſelf obliged <hi>by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> and intereſted in <hi>the Promiſes</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion, is <hi>equally concerned in the whole of them; ſeeing they together are that Covenant;</hi> And therefore (omitting now to ſpeak of the Yoke of the Law belonging thereunto) he that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64928:72"/> will apply one Promiſe or Branch of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the carnal Seed of a believing Parent (eſteeming every ſuch Parent to have an Intereſt in the Covenant coordinate with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s) ought ſeriouſly to conſider <hi>the whole promiſſory Part</hi> of the Covenant, in the true Import and Extent thereof; and ſee whether he can make ſuch an <hi>Application of it together,</hi> without manifeſt Abſurdity; For, (to paſs by other things) If I may conclude my Concern in this Covenant to be ſuch as that by one Promiſe thereof I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, That God hath taken my immediate Seed into Covenant with himſelf, I muſt on the ſame ground conclude alſo, that my Seed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Generations ſhall be no leſs in Covenant with him, ſeeing the Promiſe runs to <hi>the Seed in their Generations;</hi> yea, and that this Seed ſhall be ſeparated from other Nations as a <hi>peculiar People</hi> unto God, and ſhall have the <hi>Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion;</hi> ſeeing all theſe things are included in the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: But inaſmuch as theſe things cannot be allowed, nor are by any that I know of pleaded for; we muſt conclude, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this Covenant, not in the Capacity or Reſpect, of a <hi>private believing Parent,</hi> but of one choſen of God, to be <hi>the Father of, and a Foederal Root unto a Nation,</hi> that for ſpecial Ends ſhould be ſeparated unto God by a <hi>peculiar Covenant:</hi> And when thoſe Ends are accompliſhed, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it ſelf by which they obtained that Right,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64928:72"/> and Relation, muſt ceaſe; And the like cannot be pleaded for by any other, without a reviving of the whole Oeconomy built thereupon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their Notion, who aſſert this Covenant-Intereſt, to be the <hi>Baſis</hi> of ſuch a foederal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Believers Children under the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as gives them a Right to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> doth moreover labour under theſe Inconveniencies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They generally ſtraiten the Terms of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Intereſt (if we conſider it as derived upon <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Line) by reſtraining it to the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Offspring, which in this Covenant was not ſo reſtrained, but came as fully upon remote Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and alſo by excluding the Servants and Slaves of Chriſtians, with the Children born of them, from that Priviledg which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to have enjoyed under the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, in being ſealed with the Sign or To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant of Grace. But then;</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other hand (according to what hath been already proved) they make a Believer's Intereſt in this Covenant of larger Extent, than ever <hi>Abraham</hi>'s was in Truth; For they will have <hi>all</hi> the immediate Seed of Believers to be included in it; whereas we ſee, of all the Sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh, but <hi>one only Iſaac</hi> was admitted to the Inheritance of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and Promiſes of this Covenant.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64928:73"/> in particular Promiſes. <hi>§. 5.</hi> The ſence given, farther confirmed; This Promiſe added both to the Old Covenant, and the New: No proof that the Covenant of Circumciſion was the Covenant of Grace deducible from it. <hi>§. 6.</hi> A brief view of the Hiſtory of its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment to <hi>Iſrael. §. 7.</hi> All the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, as ſuch, fall ſhort of the Bleſſings of the New-Covenant: The firſt Tender of the Goſpel belonged to the Jews; <hi>Act. 2. 38, 39.</hi> opened. <hi>§. 8.</hi> The Covenant of Circumciſion was not that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which God brings all the Elect into; nor immediately a Covenant of ſpiritual Bleſſings: The ſolemn Worſhip of God not preſently confined to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family thereby. <hi>§. 9.</hi> The Patriarchs, and other holy Men then living, were not bound to be circumciſed, tho' intereſted in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace as well as <hi>Abraham;</hi> The Conſequence hereof. <hi>§. 10.</hi> The Queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Infants Church-memberſhip conſidered. <hi>§. 11.</hi> Five things propoſed in order to the clearing of it: No Argument for Paedo-Baptiſm can be taken from thence. <hi>§. 12.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. IT will be expedient, in the next Place, more fully to ſearch out the true meaning,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64928:74"/> and extent of <hi>that great Promiſe</hi> in the Covenant of Circumciſion, which was before but briefly touched upon; <hi>viz. I will eſtabliſh my Covenant—to be a God unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi> Gen. 17. 7. And again, The Promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion, is backed with the ſame Aſſurance; <hi>and I will be their God;</hi> v. 8. This Enquiry is the more neceſſary, becauſe many conceive, That the <hi>intire Bleſſing</hi> of the <hi>New-Covenant</hi> is comprehended in theſe words; ſeeing the like Promiſe is given forth as the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and Aſſurance of <hi>that Covenant</hi> in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. And hereupon they conclude it is <hi>the Covenant of Grace</hi> that God is now making with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and which he ſealed with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; and that ſpiritual Bleſſings are thereby directly bequeathed to him both for himſelf, and his Seed; and conſequently, it was no other than <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the Grace and Promiſe of the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> that was <hi>ſealed to his Infant Seed</hi> by Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>This Notion militates againſt diverſe things that have been before pointed at in the Account we have given of <hi>this Tranſaction;</hi> But I conceive, upon a more thorough Diſquiſition, it will be found without ſufficient Strength to ſhake thoſe Principles that are already laid down, and muſt yet be built upon, in the Progreſs of our Diſcourſe: In order therefore to free you from any Intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Objections raiſed from hence; I ſhall proceed gradually, to the Solution of the doubt moved.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:64928:74"/>
               <p>§. 2. And, that I may not be miſunderſtood in what is to follow, I ſhall prepare my way by offering theſe things to ſerious Thoughts:</p>
               <p n="1">1. A conſiderable time before this Tranſaction recorded <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. the Covenant of Grace was by God confirmed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus; and that not only in the Capacity of <hi>a private Believer;</hi> but as one bearing the <hi>Relation of a Father to all Believers:</hi> And <hi>this Relation</hi> is peculiar to himſelf; none can claim a Partnerſhip with him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the eſtabliſhment of this Covenant, there was <hi>a Seed promiſed</hi> unto him, that ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inherit the ſpiritual and eternal Bleſſings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for <hi>the Promiſe was ſure unto all the Seed:</hi> But this was <hi>a Seed of Believers</hi> collected out of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and united to Chriſt by Faith, and not <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to <hi>the Fleſh;</hi> as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt almoſt in every Page of the New-Teſtament. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hath been moreover proved, That God did chooſe <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Root, and Father of a typical People, even of a Nation, the whole Body of which he would take into a <hi>peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and Nearneſs</hi> to himſelf; and upon whom he would beſtow many great Favours and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, until <hi>the fulneſs of Time</hi> came for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of <hi>that Seed</hi> unto which the Promiſes of the New-Covenant did eminently appertain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. One great End of this Separation of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed by <hi>Iſaac</hi> from all other Families
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64928:75"/> in the Earth, was <hi>the bringing forth of the Meſſiah</hi> in his Line, and the evident Accompliſhment of <hi>the great and firſt Promiſe</hi> therein: This was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg that <hi>Abraham</hi> had in the Fleſh, and his Seed derived from him; That they were ſet apart as a <hi>ſpecial Channel,</hi> thro' which the promiſed Seed ſhould be derived and brought forth into the World: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4, 5. And therefore;</p>
               <p n="5">5. On this account their Priviledg, and <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-ſtate</hi> was ſecured unto them, ſo as they could never <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Owen's</hi> Exercitations on the <hi>Heb.</hi> Vol. 1.</note> be <hi>utterly diveſted</hi> of it in their Generations; until the great End of it was accompliſhed by the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s being come in the Fleſh: And that then it was to ceaſe, the Nature of the thing it ſelf ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrateth, in that it was now brought to the <hi>limited Time, and End,</hi> appointed to it: And hereupon all the carnal Priviledges, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Worſhip ſuited to that State, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ceaſe and become uſeleſs alſo.</p>
               <p n="6">6. During the time wherein <hi>their Covenant</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained its <hi>full Vigor,</hi> and all their carnal Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges remained good to them <hi>in their utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> all their Advantage <hi>lay ſhort of Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace;</hi> This they could never claim by virtue of a carnal Deſcent from <hi>Abraham: Mat.</hi> 3. 9. For it was not a carnal Relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but <hi>walking in the ſteps of his Faith,</hi> that alone could intereſt them in this Covenant, and the Bleſſings thereof: This the Apoſtle profeſſedly diſcourſes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64928:75"/> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and many other places: So then,</p>
               <p>§. 3. 7. The <hi>carnal,</hi> and the <hi>ſpiritual Seed,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Covenants</hi> wherein their reſpective <hi>Priviledges</hi> are ſtated, were from the Beginning, <hi>in their own Nature diſtinct</hi> the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Altho', during the <hi>Minority of the Church,</hi> under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy, theſe different Bleſſings did <hi>ordinarily meet</hi> in the ſame <hi>Subjects:</hi> For in that time the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the Fleſh comes under a twofold Conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The whole Body of them is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a People ſeparated unto God for the Ends before mentioned, and formed into a <hi>typical State</hi> by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> veſted with <hi>carnal Priviledges,</hi> and having an earthly Inheritance; which things were typical of ſpiritual Bleſſings under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As a great number of them were made the true and real Members of the ſpiritual Church, and Aſſembly of the redeemed of the Lord, who did by Faith inherit and enjoy thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings, which the outward Priviledg of the carnal Jew, was but a ſhadow of: For that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo made a <hi>typical Church;</hi> as that they were alſo the <hi>only true viſible Church</hi> that God then had i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the World: And therefore while the Wall of Separation ſtood betwixt them and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the Oracles of God were committed to them, and his true Worſhip wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſettled among them; the <hi>Covenants of Promiſe</hi> were given to them, and the way of Salvation by a Covenant of Grace,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64928:76"/> thro' the promiſed Seed, was made known (tho' but darkly) among them; and the Blood of God's <hi>ſpecial Elect</hi> did generally run in their Veines; that People who were ſavingly intereſted in God, and truly holy, being, for the moſt part found amongſt them, while the Gentiles lived <hi>without God in the World:</hi> (Thus, I ſay, it was <hi>ordinarily;</hi> for even then the Grace of God might ſuperabound to ſome few among the Gentiles) And therefore that Church that was <hi>really,</hi> and not only <hi>typically, Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> was found within the Compaſs of <hi>their Encloſure:</hi> Thus as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not only <hi>a Type</hi> of the <hi>Children of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> in the New-Teſtament, but was alſo <hi>one of them</hi> that did by Faith truly inherit the ſpiritual Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> was not only a <hi>Type of the Elect Seed,</hi> but alſo a <hi>real Part</hi> thereof; ſo the like may be ſaid of all that came after <hi>of the Circumciſion, who were not of the Circumciſion only; but, did alſo walk in the Steps of the Faith of their Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>which he had, being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed;</hi> They were in one reſpect <hi>a Type,</hi> and in another, <hi>true Members,</hi> of the <hi>general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly and Church of the Firſt-borne:</hi> Tho' the one of theſe <hi>they found as pertaining to the Fleſh;</hi> the other, <hi>they obtained by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. And, of this <hi>Iſrael in Iſrael,</hi> two things are to be obſerved;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That notwithſtanding their Intereſt in the Promiſe by Faith, they were not freed from the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64928:76"/> Yoke and Diſcipline of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, until Chriſt came: They were indeed, <hi>Children,</hi> even the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> on a ſpiritual Account; and by the Grace of a free Promiſe, which the Law could not diſannul, they were relieved from its Rigor, as to their ſpiritual and eternal State; but being <hi>Children under Age,</hi> the <hi>Paedagogy</hi> they were under, <hi>differed nothing from that of Servants;</hi> neither could they be diſcharged of <hi>this School-Maſter</hi> before Chriſt came.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were bleſſed with ſpiritual Bleſſings, and had Intereſt in eternal Life, <hi>in Circumciſion and under the Law;</hi> but none of them obtained this <hi>by Circumciſion, or by the Law:</hi> That whole Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy that <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh was under, was, <hi>in, and by, it ſelf inſufficient and weak</hi> as to the End of eternal Happineſs, and the Juſtification of a Sinner before God, in order thereto: It could not <hi>make the Comers thereunto perfect;</hi> nor make the <hi>carnal Seed</hi> Heirs of <hi>ſpiritual Bleſſings;</hi> But <hi>a Right to them</hi> was evermore grounded upon a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Intereſt in <hi>that Promiſe</hi> which the Covenant of Circumciſion was but an Hand-maid to: And therefore thoſe that <hi>reſted in</hi> their carnal Priviledges, and ſought eternal Happineſs from them, did pervert their true End, and could never obtain what they followed after.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, To conclude; The Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did belong to the Body of the carnal Seed, even to the Jewiſh Church; The Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their State is laid therein, and their Right
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64928:77"/> and Priviledg is thereby expreſly ſtated, <hi>in their Generations;</hi> And therefore, as we readily grant the Promiſe, now under conſideration, to belong to the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the Fleſh; ſo we do with good Reaſon affirm, that it muſt be taken in ſuch a ſence as we may find verified in that People and Nation, unto whom it did belong; and that ſhall no ways contradict, or interfere with, the general Deſign of the Goſpel, or the plain and indiſputable Sence of other Texts of Scripture.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Theſe things being premiſed, we ſhall now come more cloſe to the Words themſelves, and enquire <hi>what that Good, and Bleſſing is,</hi> which by them is <hi>enſured unto this Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this Promiſe, <hi>I will be their God;</hi> with that foregoing in <hi>Gen</hi> 17. 7. do give <hi>a general Aſſurance of ſome Good</hi> to the People in Covenant, is evident; but that they are Promiſes of ſome <hi>particular Good, or Bleſſing,</hi> that is of an higher Nature then is comprehended in <hi>any other Promiſes</hi> of the Covenant, is not to be ſuppoſed; For, the true Import of this general Promiſe is; <q rend="margQuotes">That God hath ingaged himſelf, and all the Properties of his Nature, for the exact fulfilling of all the Promiſes of the Covenant now made with them, according to the true Tenor, and Conditions of the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. </q> All the <hi>divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Whiſt.</hi> Prim. Doctr. p. 124.</note> are laid in as <hi>Pledges,</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:64928:77"/> that the Promiſes ſhall not fail on God's Part; ſeeing as need requires they ſhall be <hi>all exerted</hi> for the Good and Advantage of this People in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Promiſes given to them: But ſtill theſe Communications of God to them, and Actings for them, both in reſpect of the Bleſſings he will beſtow, as alſo the Terms and Conditions on which they ſhall be beſtowed, are limited by the Covenant he hath made with them, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Extent of the Promiſes thereof.</p>
               <p>And this will more plainly appear to be the true Sence, if we duly weigh <hi>the Terms</hi> of the Promiſe enquired into; <hi>(I will be their God,</hi> i. e. <hi>a God to them;</hi> They ſhall have Intereſt in all the Perfections of my Nature) For,</p>
               <p>Either God is obliged by this Promiſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf, in the higheſt Degree poſſible to all thoſe to whom it is made, and to do the utmoſt for them that may be done, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a Contradiction to his Being, and, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perfections thereof, and ſo to bring them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to the utmoſt Degree of Happineſs, that omnipotent Goodneſs can raiſe them to; or elſe the Good promiſed muſt fall under ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Limitation: If it fall under any Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; (as certainly it doth) Thoſe Bounds muſt be ſet, either by the Import of the Terms in which the Promiſe is made, as conſidered abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and by themſelves; or ſome other way: The firſt cannot be affirmed, for <hi>the Terms</hi> are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and indeterminate; Therefore it is ſome
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64928:78"/> other way to be limited; and that muſt be <hi>by the particular Promiſes, and Conditions</hi> of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, unto which this general Promiſe doth belong; And if ſo, then there is not, nor can be, any <hi>greater Good</hi> promiſed thereby, then what the Nature of that Covenant admits of, and its particular Promiſes give a Right in, to them that are Parties concerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">And theſe things being ſo; None can from hence prove a Grant of ſpiritual Bleſſings to, nor yet a Right in Goſpel Ordinances for, the carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or of any Believer, as ſuch; unleſs he could produce a particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which did contain ſuch a Grant, or give ſuch a Right, unto them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. So then, That which is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and fully expreſs'd in this Ingagement, is no more than the <hi>neceſſary Reſult of any Covenant-Tranſaction</hi> of God with Men; For where his <hi>Truth</hi> is once ingaged in a Promiſe, there <hi>all the Properties of his Nature</hi> are ingaged reſpectively, for the making good of that Promiſe: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Such a Promiſe as in its own Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no more, than <hi>a general Aſſurance</hi> of <hi>any Covenant</hi> that God makes with Men, cannot by it ſelf be the <hi>diſtinguiſhing Character</hi> of any one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in Oppoſition to, or Contradiſtinction from, another; neither doth it determine of <hi>what kind</hi> the promiſed Bleſſings are, or <hi>the way</hi> wherein they ſhall be injoyed.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64928:78"/>
               <p>And hence it is that you find this Promiſe, equally and indifferently annexed both to the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> and <hi>the New;</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> and <hi>that of Grace:</hi> The Truth of this will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by a diligent Conference of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and this with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 7. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17, 18. There is no Reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude, Becauſe we find this Promiſe in the Covenant of Grace, every Covenant in which it is found, muſt be of the <hi>ſame Nature,</hi> for the Covenant is not <hi>meaſured by this Promiſe;</hi> but <hi>è contra,</hi> its ſpecial Import, is <hi>limited by the Covenant</hi> to which it belongs.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Thus far I have indeavoured to ſet before you the <hi>Genuine Sence,</hi> and true Interpretation of this <hi>great Promiſe</hi> in the Covenant of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to give you <hi>the Reaſons</hi> by which it is confirmed; And it may add ſome farther Light to what hath been ſaid, briefly to repreſent the Hiſtory of its Accompliſhment, from the holy Scriptures, which take, as followeth.</p>
               <p>The Lord did abundantly bleſs <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and guided them with his Eye in all their Peregrinations from Nation to Nation, and from one Kingdom to another People; and when he brake the whole Staff of Bread in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the adjacent Countrys, he made Proviſion, by a wonderful Series of Providences, for the Suſtentation of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family, by ſending <hi>Joſeph</hi> before them into the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64928:79"/> for their Sakes raiſing him unto a Capacity, not only to ſecure them from Want, but alſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Lives of thouſands more: And when the Houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> was by this means brought into the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Lord was with them there; and when the time of the Promiſe drew nigh, he cauſed them to increaſe and multiply exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and tho' the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſought by all means to oppreſs them, and dealt ſubtilely with them, yet by all their Artifice and Cruelty they could make no Earnings of their Work, for the more they oppreſſed them, the more they grew: And in the midſt of their calamitous Diſtreſs <hi>Moſes</hi> was brought forth, whom the Lord had deſigned for a Deliverer and a Saviour unto them; and in order thereunto he was preſerved in a miraculous manner from all Dangers and Temptations, from his Birth to the time that he was ſent about his great Work. And in the time when the Bondage of <hi>Iſrael</hi> grew to its Extremity, the Lord's Eye was ſtill open upon them, and he heard their Cry, and remembred his Covenant with their Fathers, and ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to deliver them; Then was <hi>his Bowe made quite naked,</hi> Hab. 3. 9. in a Courſe of Miracles, by Signs, and Wonders, and mighty Works, for which his Name is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated unto all Generations; and in that very day which he had ſet in the Promiſe to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and delivered them from the Houſe of their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with an high Hand; yea he divided the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64928:79"/> Red-Sea before them, and led them thro' the Deep as on dry Land, but buried <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his Hoſt in the ſame Waters that had been as a Wall on the Right-hand and on the Left, while the redeemed of the Lord paſſed over: He guided them alſo in the Wilderneſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the viſible Token of his Preſence with them, <hi>in a Pillar of Cloud by Day, and of Fire by Night:</hi> From his Right-hand there went forth a fiery Law for them, becauſe he loved them, by which he formed both their Civil, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Polity; wherein they were immediately ſubjected to himſelf, and made a Kingdom of Prieſts and an holy Nation; and the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was pitched in the midſt of them, ſo that there was no Nation under Heaven that had God ſo nigh, as the Lord their God was unto them in all that they did call upon him for. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he gave his good Spirit to inſtruct them, which was poured upon <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> with the ſeventy Elders, and thoſe Prophets which from time to time, God raiſed up among them: He fed them alſo with Manna from Heaven, and gave them Water out of the Rock to drink; and all the time of their forty Years Travel in the Wilderneſs, their Feet were not ſwollen, neither did their Garments wax old: He dryed up <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> alſo, and brought them into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and drove out before them Nations more in number, and mightier than they; and there he bleſſed them with the Bleſſings of Heaven
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64928:80"/> above, and of the Earth beneath; ſo that there <hi>failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had ſpoken concerning them;</hi> Joſh. 23. 14. but their State was made proſperous and happy, bcauſe <hi>the Lord was their God;</hi> Pſal. 144. <hi>ult.</hi> And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their Provocations, he had Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them, when in their Diſtreſſes they cryed unto him; and delivered them, ſo that the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did not depart from <hi>Judah,</hi> nor a Law-giver from between his Feet untill <hi>Shiloh (i. e.</hi> Chriſt) came. Much of this you have ſumm'd up in <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105 and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. with <hi>Act.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>§. 8. In all theſe Reſpects (with others of like Nature before inſiſted on) there was <hi>a Glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7,—11. upon the Miniſtration of the Old Teſtament; The <hi>Jew</hi> had a <hi>great Advantage,</hi> and there was <hi>Profit of Circumciſion;</hi> but <hi>chiefly in that to them were committed the Oracles of God;</hi> Rom. 3. 1. and Chap. 9. 4. Their's were <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of Promiſe;</hi> and the ſolemn Worſhip of God was maintained among then; For <hi>Salvation was of the Jews;</hi> Joh. 4. 22. and in theſe things was this Promiſe fulfilled, <hi>That the Lord would be a God to them</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Many to whom the Lord <hi>was a God</hi> according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, dyed in their Sins, and were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loſt; But thoſe <hi>to whom he is a God,</hi> according to the Tenor of the New Covenant, receive from him, the Bleſſings of a new Heart, Remiſſion of Sins, and eternal Salvation.</note> 
                  <hi>in their Generations;</hi> And yet all this lies ſhort of an actual, perſonal, and ſaving Intereſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64928:80"/> in the Covenant of Grace; as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> argues at large in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Chap.</hi> 9, 10, 11. Neither could he have affirmed that the committing of the Oracles of God to them was the <hi>chief Profit</hi> or greateſt Benefit of Circumciſion, if ever God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be <hi>the Seal of their Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace;</hi> which undoubtedly is much greater than any <hi>external Benefit</hi> or Advantage: But moreover,</p>
               <p>This Priviledg the Jews had, That as the Son of God was to be made Fleſh of the Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> and to be <hi>manifeſted</hi> among them, being made <hi>a Miniſter of the Circumciſion for the fulfilling of the Promiſes made unto the Fathers:</hi> Rom. 15. 8. ſo alſo, the <hi>firſt Tender</hi> of the Grace, and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, did of Right belong unto them: The preaching of Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins in Chriſt's Name was to begin at <hi>Jeruſalem: Luk.</hi> 24. 47. And as this was an Argument of God's great Favour, ſo it might be unto them a great Incouragement to receive the Goſpel, and expect Salvation by Chriſt according to the Tender made therein; And for this End is it urged by <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2. 38, 39. <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, and Ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt. For the Promiſe is to you and to your Children,</hi> &amp;c. The Promiſe which he hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reſpect to, is that before cited, of the Salvation of all who in the day of the Goſpel
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64928:81"/> call upon the Name of the Lord, and the <hi>pouring out of his Spirit upon all Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 21. (The Promiſe of the Spirit is alſo mentioned by <hi>Paul,</hi> as the great Bleſſing of the Goſpel <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14.) The Spirit was then to be poured out upon many in the miraculous and extraordinary Gifts thereof; and upon all true Believers in a New-Teſtament Meaſure; accordingly the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorts them to the Obedience of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that they might obtain the Remiſſion of their Sins, and receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt; which he aſſures them of, upon the Terms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Promiſe is to you, and your Children:</hi> You are in no wiſe excluded from the Hope of this Bleſſing, tho' you have been the Betrayers and Murtherers of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but on the contrary, you (as Jews) have a ſpecial Intereſt in the Promiſe, ſo far as that its Accompliſhment is to be begun among you, and the firſt Offer of its Bleſſing belongs to you; An actual Intereſt in the Promiſe unto Salvation, they could not have until they believed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; but as before explained, the <hi>Promiſe</hi> was <hi>to them</hi> while Unbelievers; and in a like ſence the, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of them, That the <hi>Covenants,</hi> and the <hi>Promiſes</hi> (as well as the <hi>giving of the Law, and Levitical Service)</hi> were <hi>theirs Rom.</hi> 9. 4. Their Covenant brought <hi>Salvation</hi> to them; but it was the receiving of it by Faith, when ſo tendered, that gave them particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it. And the Intereſt of <hi>their Children,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:64928:81"/> or <hi>Poſterity, in the Promiſes,</hi> can reach no farther then their's, from whom it is ſuppoſed to be derived. And it is the ſame thing in Effect, that <hi>Peter</hi> urgeth upon the ſame People, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade their Obedience to the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Act. 3. 25, 26. Ye are the Children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſaying unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>and in thy Seed ſhall all the Kindreds of the Earth be bleſſed. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning every one of you from his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſuitable hereunto, we find the Apoſtles in all Places, where they came with the glad Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Goſpel, firſt applyed themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jews; as holding it <hi>neceſſary that the Word of God ſhould firſt be preached unto them,</hi> Act. 13. 46, 47.</p>
               <p>§. 9. From that Account which hath been given of the <hi>Covenant of Circumciſion, the Nature, and Promiſes thereof;</hi> theſe <hi>Corolaries do follow;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That this was <hi>a Covenant of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> as having its Original from the meer Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and undeſerved Favour of God towards <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 7. 7, 8. whereby many excellent Priviledges were given to them, which no other Nation under Heaven had a Right in, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and theſe were conferred on them in Purſuance of the great Deſign of God's Grace in the Covenant of Redemption by Chriſt: Yet
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64928:82"/> was it not <hi>that Covenant of Grace,</hi> which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> for all his ſpiritual Seed, which was before confirmed of God in Chriſt, and thro' which <hi>all Nations</hi> (that is, true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in every Nation) have been ever ſince, now are, and ſhall be, <hi>bleſſed</hi> with the ſpiritual and eternal Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Altho' it be granted, This Covenant had ultimately a reſpect to ſpiritual Bleſſings, as it was diſpoſed in the manifold Wiſdom of God in a <hi>Subſerviency</hi> to the Covenant of Grace, and as <hi>added to the Promiſe</hi> until the fulneſs of Time came; yet was it not <hi>immediately and directly,</hi> a Covenant of ſpiritual Bleſſings, nor could it ever convey to the carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſuch, a Right, and Intereſt in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding the Promiſes made in this Covenant of Circumciſion, and the Separation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be the peculiar People of God, in Purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, whoſe Church-ſtate was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Covenant in the Wilderneſs, when the ſet Time for the fulfilling of thoſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in that reſpect was fully come; Yet for the preſent this Covenant did not confine the ſolemn Worſhip of God (by Sacrifices or otherwiſe) to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family; nor were <hi>other holy Men</hi> then living, under any Obligation to <hi>incorporate</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereinto, <hi>by Circumciſion,</hi> or at all to take upon them that <hi>Sign or Seal</hi> of this <hi>Covenant of Peculiarity</hi> that God now made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> which yet without doubt they ſhould have done
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64928:82"/> if in its firſt Inſtitution it had been given ſimply, and directly, as a <hi>Seal of the Covenant of Grace;</hi> for then by reaſon of their Intereſt in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, both in point of Duty, and Priviledg, it had equally belonged unto them, as to the Seed and Family of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. But, from the ſacred Hiſtory it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That the Command by virtue of which Circumciſion was adminiſtred, extended no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Family; And therefore we have no ground to conclude, that <hi>Lot</hi> (tho' nearly allyed to <hi>Abraham)</hi> was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, ſeeing there is nothing in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, or firſt Inſtitution of Circumciſion that obliged him thereunto, or intereſted him therein; and yet there is no Doubt to be made of his Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Lot</hi> the only righteous Man then living in the World, beſides thoſe of <hi>Abrham</hi>'s Family; for <hi>of the Patriarchs, Heber, Salah,</hi> and <hi>Shem</hi> were now living; and as they had their <hi>diſtinct Families,</hi> and Intereſts, ſo there is no Queſtion but the pure Worſhip of God was maintained in them; and they promoted the Intereſt of true Religion to the utmoſt of their Power while they lived; Yea <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was in Being about this time (whether he was <hi>Shem</hi> before named, or another, it concerns not us to inquire, much leſs to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but this is certain that it was he) who was <hi>the Prieſt of the moſt high God, and King of</hi> Salem,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64928:83"/> and in both theſe reſpects the moſt eminent Type of Jeſus Chriſt that ever was in the World; a Perſon greater than <hi>Abraham,</hi> for <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tythes to him, and was bleſſed by him; Now conſidering that he was both King and Prieſt, there is no doubt but there was <hi>a Society of Men</hi> that were ruled by him, and for whom he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred; for a Prieſt is <hi>ordained for Men</hi> in things pertaining to God; and this <hi>Society</hi> was at this time, as much <hi>a Church of God</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was, and as truly intereſted in the Covenant of Grace as any therein; yet were they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as Parties in this Covenant of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor to be <hi>ſigned</hi> thereby; And hence it is manifeſt, that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was not at firſt applyed as a <hi>Seal of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> nor did an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt therein preſently render a Man the proper Subject <hi>of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; To ſuppoſe that all good Men then living, ſhould have been circumciſed, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and their Offspring bound to keep this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in their Generations, as his were, would neceſſarily fruſtrate one great (if not the greateſt) End of Circumciſion, and the Covenant thereof, which was the ſeparating of one Family, and People from all others in the World, for the bringing forth of the <hi>Meſſiah, that promiſed Seed,</hi> of them, and among them, for the eſtabliſhing of all the Promiſes made unto the Fathers. And moreover the Promiſe of this Covenant touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inheritance of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> could
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64928:83"/> never have been made good to them all; And yet certainly the ſealing of that Promiſe, was one thing intended in Circumciſion. From the whole it appears;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That as on the one hand, there was a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Command which made it neceſſary to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe many that never had Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace; ſo, on the other hand, from the firſt Date of Circumciſion there were many truly interſted in the Covenant of Grace, who were under no Obligation to be circumciſed. </q>So far it is from Truth that a <hi>New Covenant-Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Right to Circumciſion,</hi> may be inferred the one from the other.</p>
               <p>§. 11. I ſhould here have put a cloſe to this Chapter; but that I judg it may be convenient in this place, briefly to touch upon that Notion <hi>of Infant's Church-memberſhip,</hi> which is much ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of with Reference to thoſe Times, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of which we have already paſt thro'; And the rather, becauſe of the Light we may receive from the things already diſcourſed, to guide us to a right Underſtanding of the true State of the Queſtion about it; By many <hi>ſuch a thing</hi> is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have been <hi>from the Beginning,</hi> and great Weight is laid upon it in the Controverſie about the right Subjects of Baptiſm; It being judged to afford a ſufficient ground for applying the Seal of the Covenant to the Infant Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. For my own part I find not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64928:84"/> Occaſion given for any long Diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; and I ſhall not deſire to be <hi>wiſe above what is written;</hi> And therefore I ſhall endeavour in few Words to repreſent ſome things grounded upon the records of matter of Fact, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I conceive may be ſufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our Thoughts, as to the Iſſue of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enquiry about it. And they are theſe that follow:</p>
               <p>§. 12. Firſt; The term <hi>Church</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is not (that I find) applyed to any <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Society of Men</hi> united in one Body, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the maintaining of the publick and ſolemn Worſhip of God among themſelves; before the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were compleately formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church-ſtate, by the Covenant that God made with them in the Wilderneſs; They are called <hi>the Church in the Wilderneſs,</hi> Act. 7. 38. Yet I doubt not but <hi>all good Men</hi> before that time did belong to that <hi>general Aſſembly,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> which Chriſt hath redeemed with his Blood, and made the Members of his Body; and I grant that we may (uſing the Term in a more laxe ſence) call any <hi>Family</hi> or <hi>Society of Men</hi> truly worſhiping God, <hi>a Church of God.</hi> Nevertheleſs, if we conſider the Circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the different State of things in thoſe different Times, it will appear, that <hi>no Society</hi> before the Jewiſh Church was formed, can be called a <hi>Church</hi> in ſo ſtrict, and proper a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64928:84"/> ſence as they might; for no other were <hi>ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into a Church-ſtate</hi> as they were.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, there was <hi>no Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of an outward Sign, or, Seal of any Covenant</hi> to be applyed either to Infants or adult Perſons; And therefore there could be no <hi>Inauguration</hi> of this kind, or <hi>ſolemn Right of Initiation to Church Priviledg</hi> then in Uſe among them. All that can be ſaid of the Children born in thoſe Families and Societies, muſt iſſue in things of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>viz.</hi> That they were under a more ſpecial and gracious Providence of God than others, as being Members of a Family peculiarly intereſted therein: They had alſo the Benefit of continual Prayers for them, and the Advantage of early and diligent Inſtruction, being brought up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord; and ſo preſerved from many Snares and Temptations that others are liable to, by the Diſcipline they were under; And being provoked to Religion by the pious and holy Example of thoſe they converſed with; as ſoon they were capable of it (if, when grown up, they did not break thro' all theſe Fences, and revolt to a wicked and irreligious Life) they <hi>actually joyned</hi> with that Family and Society to which they belonged, in the ſolemn Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we conſider <hi>Church-memberſhip</hi> in ſuch a Notion of it as will agree to that time wherein <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was firſt inſtituted, we can by no means conclude that a Right to Circumciſion
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64928:85"/> did reſult therefrom; For certainly the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and other good Men then living, and their Families, were as truly Church-members, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Family; yet were they not therefore to be circumciſed, but the <hi>particular, Law and poſitive Inſtitution</hi> of this Ordinance, did alone determine the Subjects thereof. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over;</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was not <hi>Memberſhip in</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> ſingly and ſimply conſidered, that brought a Perſon under the Law of Circumciſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to other <hi>Circumſtances of Time and Sex</hi> expreſly ſet down in the Inſtitution; For Circumciſion was to be applyed to <hi>the Males only,</hi> tho' the Right of <hi>Church-memberſhip</hi> belonged as as well <hi>to the Females</hi> as to them: And it is no ſatisfactory Anſwer to ſay the Female is not a <hi>Subject capable</hi> of Circumciſion; For if it had pleaſed God to have made <hi>Church-memberſhip the reaſon and ground</hi> of applying this Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he could eaſily have appointed <hi>ſuch a Sign,</hi> as <hi>all Members</hi> had been capable of; Beſides, how doth it appear that the Females were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncapable of any kind of Circumciſion? Save that God required no ſuch thing: <hi>Vitriacus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that the <hi>Jacobites uſe Circumciſion of both Sexes;</hi> and ſo do the <hi>Habaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines;</hi> and therefore the thing <note place="margin">Breerw. Inquir.</note> in it ſelf is not impoſſible; that which hath been done, may be done: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over we find the circumciſing of the <hi>Males</hi> was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64928:85"/> limited to the eighth day; it might not be done ſooner, nor delayed longer: and <hi>the Slaves</hi> that were bought with Mony <hi>muſt needs be circumciſed,</hi> tho' they were no Church-members, nor the Children of ſuch; from all which it is manifeſt, that they proceeded not upon a Notion of <hi>Church-memberſhip,</hi> but were ſtrictly governed by Divine-Inſtitution in the matter of circumciſing or not circumciſing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To conclude; It is granted that the <hi>Jewiſh Infants</hi> were <hi>born Members of that Church;</hi> This Priviledg they had in the Fleſh; But this evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongs unto <hi>the national and typical Church-ſtate</hi> of that People; which State by the Goſpel is diſſolved, and is ſo inconſiſtent with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thereof, that the Poſition of the one, neceſſarily infers the Abolition of the other; And therefore this Right and Priviledg of the Jew which was in the very Foundation of their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church-ſtate, as ſeparated from the Gentiles, cannot be transfer'd into, becauſe it will not comport with, the Goſpel-diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Beſides, It is evident throughout the whole Goſpel, that Right of Memberſhip in the Jewiſh Church, could never give to any, either Infant or Adult, a like Right of Memberſhip in the Goſpel Church; nor was there ever any one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thereinto, <hi>co nomine,</hi> becauſe he had ſuch a Right according to the State of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And there is good Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the carnal Seed of Believers can derive
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64928:86"/> no higher Priviledg from the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, then the carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thereby: And if it could not bring the one into the Goſpel Church, nor give them a Right to Baptiſm without an actual Compliance with the Terms of the Goſpel, by Repentance and Faith, it can by no means do ſo for the other, tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe them concerned in it, as indeed they are not.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">It remains therefore; That as Circumciſion of old Time was adminiſtred according to the poſitive Law, and expreſs Will of the Lord; ſo ought Baptiſm to be now, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; neither can I ſee any ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for <hi>Paedobaptiſm,</hi> until ſuch a divine Law can be produced for the warrant of it, as was of old given, for circumciſing the Male Infants of the Jews.</q>

               <p>§. 1. IN the Chapters foregoing, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to treat diſtinctly of the Promiſes given to <hi>Abraham;</hi> firſt of thoſe that belong to his ſpiritual, and then of ſuch as appertain to his carnal Seed; which Promiſes (notwithſtanding their different Nature, and Importance) we have found frequently <hi>intermixed in the ſame Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi> of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> they being in the ſacred Hiſtory preſented to us <hi>interwoven</hi> the one

               <p>That this <hi>Order and Diſpoſition</hi> of the Promiſes is excellently ſuited to the <hi>Diſpenſation of thoſe Times</hi> wherein they were given forth, and to that State of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Church which was, not long after, to be built upon them: For theſe things were tranſacted long before the time appointed for the clear breaking up of Goſpel-light to the World, which was not to be expected till Chriſt came in the Fleſh, before whoſe coming the Law was to take place, and the Oeconomy of the Old Covenant to remain for many Generations: And therefore, altho' the Goſpel was preached unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet was it not delivered unto him with that <hi>Plainneſs and Perſpiouity</hi> as it is in the New-Teſtament, but for the moſt part as ſhadowed and figured by outward things: And hence, That which concerns the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy is <hi>more expreſly and fully</hi> declared unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> than what concerns his ſpiritual Seed under the Goſpel; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho' this latter be the chief thing intended and aimed at (becauſe the perfection of all the reſt) in all divine Tranſactions with <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:64928:88"/> yet is it, for the moſt part, <hi>myſtically infolded in,</hi> and to be inferred from, <hi>the typical Reſpect</hi> of the other thereunto; which leaves the Glory of Goſpel-grace ſtill under that <hi>Vail,</hi> which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Old Teſtament-ſtate of the Church; the <hi>full opening</hi> of thoſe Promiſes that did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately belong to the Covenant of Grace, being reſerved for another State of things in the Church; <hi>God having provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect:</hi> Heb. 11. 40. A dim Light was ſuited to thoſe Times; and it could be but dim, ſo long as the Promiſes lay ſo much intangled one within another. The like is to be obſerved in After-times, in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Mind of God to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; For in the prophetick Writings (as it appears that the temporal Deliverances of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are conſidered as typical of the ſpiritual Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church; ſo) we often meet with ſudden, and (ſeemingly) abrupt Tranſitions from the Promiſes of things relating to the preſent State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, unto Promiſes and Prophecies of thoſe things which are accompliſhed in the New-Teſtament by the Miniſtration of the Spirit, which being generally delivered in Terms ſuitable to the preſent Diſpenſation of things, and their typical Reſpect, are by the Jews wofully perverted unto this day, while they contend that themſelves are <hi>the only People</hi> concerned in them, to whom the Bleſſings, promiſed and propheſied of, do belong; and that they are to be fulfilled
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64928:88"/> unto them in a way agrecable to their former State, and ſuited to their own carnal Luſts and Imaginations; whereby they harden themſelves in their Contempt of the Grace of God in Chriſt, and the ſpiritual Bleſſings of the Goſpel, wherein the Accompliſhment of thoſe Prophecies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true Sence of them, is only to be ſought. And thus Jeſus Chriſt himſelf became a Stone of ſtumbling, and Rock of Offence to them; becauſe the State of his Kingdom ſuited not their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Minds, nor anſwered their groundleſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
               <p>§. 3. It is alſo to be obſerved; That there is not only a ſingular <hi>Congruity, and Fitneſs</hi> in <hi>this Method</hi> of giving forth the Promiſes, in regard of the Time wherein they were made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that State of the Church which was next to follow upon theſe Tranſactions; but there is alſo in ſome reſpect <hi>a Neceſſity</hi> of it ariſing from the <hi>Nature of the things promiſed, and their mutual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence one upon the other.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>All the Promiſes of a ſpiritual Seed, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bleſſings to be beſtowed on that Seed, (which belong to the Covenant of Grace as revealed to <hi>Abraham)</hi> are <hi>Yea and Amen in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> And this <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in whom the Covenant was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was to be made <hi>of the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh;</hi> and for the bringing of him forth, according to the Promiſe, was the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeparated unto God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64928:89"/> for a peculiar People, and kept diſtinct from all other Families in the World; and in this reſpect, the Bleſſing of Grace and eternal Life given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his believing Seed, was ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Effect and Accompliſhment of the Promiſes concerning his natural Offspring; and particularly upon the Promiſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Birth; who was to be begotten by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and brought forth by <hi>Sarah,</hi> at ſuch a time, when <hi>Nature</hi> in them both was <hi>ſo weakned by Age,</hi> that they were as unapt, he to beget, and ſhe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Son, as if they had been <hi>already dead,</hi> Rom. 4. 19. And hence it is, that the Apoſtle doth lay ſo great Weight upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith in this Particular, even in the Buſineſs of his Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before God; The <hi>Object</hi> of juſtifying Faith, <hi>the Meſſiah to come,</hi> being thus included in the Promiſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Birth: On this account his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had the greateſt Cauſe of rejoycing at the Birth of this Son, who hath his Name from <hi>Laughter,</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing: Gen.</hi> 17. 17. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. And to this (in part) may be referred the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour, <hi>Abraham rejoyced to ſee my Day, and he ſaw it, and was glad:</hi> Joh. 8. 56. He ſaw it in the Birth of <hi>Iſaac</hi> (and afterwards in the offering of him up) who was a Type of Chriſt, and from whom he was to come; whoſe miraculous Birth, in the virtue of a Promiſe, when Nature could not have effected it, afforded alſo ſome Adumbration of, and was a Praeludium to, the more miraculous Birth of Chriſt, who
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64928:89"/> was conceived and brought forth by a pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin (the Power of the moſt High overſhadowing her) for the fufilling of that Promiſe, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Head of the Serpent.</hi> As <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the Type, ſo Chriſt more eminently, <hi>ſprang up as a Root out of a dry Ground;</hi> Iſa! 53.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Now from theſe things we may collect with Eaſe, and great Clearneſs, wherein <hi>the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Tryal, and the Eminency of his Faith <hi>in offering up Iſaac,</hi> did ſpecially conſiſt: To part with a Son, an obedient Son; a Son grown up (as <hi>Iſaac</hi> now was) yea an only Son, was indeed <hi>a great Tryal;</hi> howbeit <hi>Abraham</hi> was not only required to part with him, but <hi>to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him;</hi> and for a Father to become the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of his Son, the Son of his old Age, and the Object of his moſt endeared Affections; for him (I ſay) to be appointed the Prieſt that muſt ſlay this <hi>Victime,</hi> adds yet <hi>much more</hi> to the Tryal; And in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s addreſſing himſelf to ſuch a Service (had there been no more in it) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Debate, murmuring, or delay, we have an unparallell'd Inſtance, and Example of <hi>Piety, and Obedience:</hi> But alas! There is a Concern infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater, in this Caſe, than all that hath been yet mentioned; <hi>Iſaac was the Son of the Promiſe,</hi> (And upon <hi>this account</hi> the Holy Ghoſt places it—<hi>he that had received the Promiſes offered up his only begotten Son: Of whom it was ſaid, in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called;</hi> Heb. 11. 17, 18.) <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:64928:90"/> had no other Son in whom he might expect the fulfilling of the Promiſe when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was loſt; and yet upon the Accompliſhment of this Promiſe, in the bringing forth of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Line, the <hi>eternal Salvation</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the <hi>whole Church</hi> depended; and therefore he is called <hi>his only begotten,</hi> not becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had no other Son, but becauſe he was <hi>the only H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> This might have cauſed the greateſt Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Mind imaginable, in <hi>Abraham,</hi> had he at all conſulted with Fleſh and Blood in the caſe; but his Faith overcame this Difficulty, and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all carnal Reaſonings about the Impoſſibility of the Accompliſhment of the Promiſe, if this Command were obeyed; <hi>Accounting that God was able to raiſe him up, even from the Dead,</hi> from whence alſo <hi>he received him in a Figure:</hi> Heb. 11. 19. And the Iſſue made it abundantly manifeſt, that the readineſs of <hi>Abraham</hi> to obey in this Caſe, did put the Promiſe to no real Hazard; for it brought forth means of farther Confirmation of his Faith, by the Exhibition of <hi>an eminent Type</hi> of the Redemption of the Church by the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt; unto which was added <hi>the renewing of God's Promiſes</hi> to him, both for his ſpiritual and carnal Seed and that with their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation by the Oath</hi> of the great God: <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 17, 18. But to return to that which concerns our preſent Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>From theſe things we may certainly collect, that <hi>all the Promiſes</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64928:90"/> of God <hi>to meet in one general Iſſue;</hi> For as the Promiſes concerning the carnal Seed, and their State, were ſubſervient unto the Ends of of God's Covenant with the ſpiritual Seed: ſo alſo the the Promiſes peculiarly belonging to the ſpiritual Seed, were to have their Effect and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment <hi>in a Seed that muſt deſcend from</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>according to the Fleſh:</hi> And therefore that <hi>Interchange</hi> of the Promiſes which hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to you, ought not in any wiſe to ſeem ſtrange.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Again, The <hi>typical Reſpect and Analogy of the Covenant of Peculiarity unto the Covenant of Grace,</hi> as after to be more fully revealed, and accompliſhed in Chriſt, affords another Occaſion of, and Reaſon for, the <hi>interweaving</hi> of thoſe Promiſes which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a diſtinct Application: ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing immediately to the carnal, and others to the ſpiritual Seed, as ariſing from the ſprings, and ordered towards the Miniſtration of two diſtinct Covenants: That there was a Diſpoſition of things in the Old Teſtament with <hi>a typical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> to the things that are of a ſpiritual Nature, and Concern, in the New, is ſo fully, and clearly aſſerted by the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures, that it hath obtained a general Acknowledgment from thoſe that own their Authority; as alſo that many things in the Tranſactions of God with <hi>Abraham</hi> were of this Nature; largely to inſiſt on theſe things is beſides my preſent Deſign; only
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64928:91"/> for the better clearing of the Point under Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, I ſhall briefly touch upon ſomething of this kind: And firſt, let it be obſerved;</p>
               <p>That the Body of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>as an holy People, and the Lord's firſt-born,</hi> Exod. 4. 22, 23. Jer. 2. 3. bearing in their Fleſh the Character of Circumciſion (which laid them under an Obligation to perform the Righteouſneſs of the Law) was not only a Seed ſeparated unto God for the bringing forth of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but alſo, was <hi>a Type of Chriſt myſtical,</hi> viz. of that Seed, and Body, whereof Chriſt is the Head, and true Believers are the Members (who in this Relation are conſidered as compleat in him) and ſo did eminently point at his being made <hi>under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. and (by the perfect fulfilling thereof) becoming <hi>the End of the Law for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to every one that believeth;</hi> Rom. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>Thus much (I ſuppoſe) may be fairly gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that ſaying of the Prophet in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Junii An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notationes in locum, &amp; ejuſdem</hi> Parallela.</note> 
                  <hi>Out of</hi> Egypt <hi>have I called my Son;</hi> compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 15. where the Evangeliſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it unto Chriſt. And, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably for this reaſon is Chriſt propheſied of by the Name of <hi>Iſrael, Eſa.</hi> 49. 3. Chriſt was <hi>the Seed</hi> in whom the Subſtance of that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that was ſhadowed in the Circumciſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was to be found; and from whom it is derived upon all true Believers for their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God, and <hi>Introduction into ſuch a</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:64928:91"/> 
                  <hi>State</hi> wherein they ſhould acceptably walk before God, and worſhip him in <hi>newneſs of Spirit:</hi> Thus Circumciſion did not only oblige to the keeping of the Law (in which reſpect, it was an heavy Yoke <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10.) but did alſo (as ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Promiſe) point at the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> who was to come under a legal Bond to fulfil all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that thro' Faith in his Name ſuch a Righteouſneſs might be obtained, as is <hi>witneſſed to both by the Law and the Prophets:</hi> Rom. 3. 21. It is <hi>Chriſt alone,</hi> in whom the Deſign of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is <hi>fully anſwered:</hi> And as under the Old Teſtament-Miniſtration, no Man could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Priviledges of the Covenant of Peculiarity without Circumciſion, none being admitted to walk before God in that Covenant, without <hi>this Sign</hi> of a perfect Righteouſneſs and Purity accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law; ſo now, none can have entrance into the Kingdom of Grace, nor obtain a Right in the ſpiritual Bleſſings and Priviledges of the New-Covenant, but by an Intereſt in the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> thro' Faith, and by coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Imputation of his Obedience, wherein the Law was fulfilled for us. And ſeeing this was one (and that the moſt comfortable, if not the chief) end of Circumciſion, as it ſerved the Deſign of the Covenant of Grace towards the Elect; the Continuance of it now, with the ſame reſpect which it had in its firſt Inſtitution, would be in effect, <hi>to deny that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I intend not by any thing I have ſaid to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64928:92"/> a Denial of the typical reſpect of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>to the Sanctification of Believers alſo;</hi> neither is that Notion of it in the leaſt weakened, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrengthened in its proper Place; For as the <hi>real Holineſs</hi> of Believers ſprings from <hi>their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Chriſt,</hi> and Juſtification thro' the Faith of his Name; ſo I take Circumciſion, firſt to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that perfect Righteouſneſs which we have in Jeſus Chriſt; and then to that ſincere (tho' imperfect) Holineſs that is wrought in us by the Spirit of Chriſt: <hi>For we are the Circumciſion which worſhip God in the Spirit; and rejoyce in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and have no Confidence in the Fleſh:</hi> Phil. 3. 3.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And I conceive if thoſe other Texts in the New-Teſtament that look towards the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical uſe of Circumciſion, be well weighed, and the ſcope of the Context in which they are, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, they will caſt a great Light upon the Notion propoſed to you; I cannot ſtay upon all, But for Inſtance, let us repair to <hi>Col. 2. 11. In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made without hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The deſign of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe in the whole Context, is, to confirm the Souls of the believing <hi>Coloſſians</hi> in the Faith of the Goſpel, and particularly in that great Article of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion concerning our <hi>being juſtified freely by the Grace of God, thro' the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> Rom. 3. 24. and to <hi>caution</hi> them
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64928:92"/> not to be led away by the <hi>Errour of the Wicked</hi> from the <hi>Simplicity of Truth</hi> which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; <hi>But as they had received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; ſo they ſhould walk in him: Rooted and built up in him, and eſtabliſhed in the Faith;</hi> ver. 6, 7. And (ſaith he) <hi>Beware leſt any Man ſpoile you through Philoſophy and vain Deceit, after the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt;</hi> ver. 8. The Men which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle brands in theſe laſt Words, are thoſe that endeavour'd the Subverſion of the Liberty of the Gentile Churches, and intangling them again in the yoke of Legal Bondage; in order whereunto, they did not only aſſert the <hi>Levitical Ceremonies,</hi> to be ſtill, and in their own nature, acceptable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God; but alſo, that they were of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Uſe, becauſe of thoſe <hi>Philoſophick Secrets, and Myſteries of Nature,</hi> which they pretended were wrapt up in them; which Conceit they had no ground for (God having at no time appointed them to ſuch an End) but from the <hi>Tradition</hi> of their Elders: This it is which the Apoſtle intends, by <hi>Philoſophy and vain Deceit after the Tradition of Men:</hi> And, to prevent their being inſnared with this corrupt Doctrine, he informs them how Chriſt was <hi>the End and Subſtance</hi> of all thoſe Shadows, and that all Fulneſs dwels in him, <hi>in whom they were compleat;</hi> and therefore ought not to turn back to the Law, or its Ceremonies, to ſeek <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> from them; ſeeing by Chriſt they were made Partakers of that real Benefit, which was
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64928:93"/> but darkly pointed at, and ſhadowed by the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law: For ſo he adds in this 11th <hi>Verſe, In whom alſo ye are circumciſed;</hi> (mind) They are not ſaid to be circumciſed <hi>in themſelves,</hi> but <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> becauſe in him they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleately juſtified <hi>by the Imputation of a perfect Righteouſneſs,</hi> which Circumciſion under the Law, as an Ordinance of the Old Covenant, did oblige Men to, and as ſubordinate to the Promiſe did prefigure: Hence the Apoſtle affirms, that <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are the Circumciſion,</hi> who place their whole Truſt in Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. and whereas they are alſo deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>worſhip God in the Spirit;</hi> this doth not reſtrain the Notion of their Circumciſion to the Righteouſneſs of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather deſcribes the Perſons by another Fruit, and Property, of that Grace whereby they are juſtified; <hi>Confer. Rom.</hi> 8. 4. In the following words of this Text in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> the Circumciſion ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is ſaid to be,—<hi>In the putting off the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Sins of the Fleſh;</hi> which is primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of our Juſtification, and includes Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as a neceſſary Concomitant thereof; It is by Juſtification that we are compleatly delivered from <hi>a State of Sin, and the Maſs of Corruption (as</hi> Joſhua <hi>was from his filthy Garments)</hi> Zach. 3. 4. by an Implantation into, and Union with Chriſt, who dyed for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification; and therefore this change of their State, is ſaid to be, by their <hi>being quickned together with Chriſt;</hi> ver. 13. and this quickning is that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64928:93"/> of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> wherein they were raiſed from that deadly ſtate of Guiltineſs, in which they were, while <hi>dead in their Sins, and the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of their Fleſh,</hi> unto a ſtate of Life, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Acceptance with God, <hi>who forgives them all Treſpaſſes.</hi> Now this <hi>putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh,</hi> is,</p>
               <p>—<hi>By the Circumciſion of Chriſt.</hi> I know Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors do generally take that Circumciſion which is the work of the Spirit of Chriſt in the Soul, to be here intended; as they do apply the whole Verſe to our Sanctification; but I conceive as our Juſtification is primarily intended in the Context, ſo the ſcope of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe leads us rather to interpret this to be <hi>that Circumciſion wherewith Chriſt was circumciſed;</hi> the <hi>Sign</hi> being put for the <hi>thing ſignified;</hi> viz. the Circumciſion of Chriſt, for his perfect Obedience, and fufilling of the Law: In Circumciſion was the firſt bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Yoke of the Law; and by it the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon circumciſed was bound to keep the whole Law, otherwiſe his <hi>Circumciſion became <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;</hi> Rom. 2. 25. ſo then, the Circumciſion of Chriſt is a convincing Evidence of his being <hi>made under the Law;</hi> and by a perfect fulfilling thereof, he brought in that everlaſting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, thro' the Imputation of which, all that are in him are juſtified before God: And <hi>this Communion</hi> that Believers have with Chriſt in his Benefits thro' the Faith of the Operation of God, is in a lively manner held out, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64928:94"/> to them in their Baptiſm, wherein they are ſaid to be both <hi>buried and riſen together with him;</hi> Col. 2. 12. The Immerſion of the Body into the Water bearing an Analogy to his Burial, as the raiſing of it again out of the Water doth to his Reſurrection. This the Apoſtle intends, that even their Baptiſm upon their firſt receiving, and profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, did teach and oblige them to live upon Chriſt alone, and to joyn no other thing with him in the Foundation of their Hope.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo, Circumciſion was of Uſe no longer, neither had Chriſtians any Concernment in it; for having reached the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of its utmoſt End in Jeſus Chriſt, it expired in Courſe, and vaniſhed away with the whole Frame of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy: And ſo far is the Apoſtle from intimating that Baptiſm came in the room of Circumciſion, that he diſcourſes of them, as appertaining to <hi>two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants ſo differenced</hi> one from the other, and <hi>in their compleat Miniſtration oppoſed</hi> the one to the other, as that they could by no means (in this laſt reſpect) conſiſt together.</p>
               <p>§. 7. In the next place; It is to be noted,</p>
               <p>That there was <q rend="margQuotes">

That <hi>Abraham</hi> had a twofold Seed; the one proceeding from him according to the ordinary Courſe, and by the Strength of Nature, the other brought forth by virtue of a Promiſe; the one was <hi>Iſhmael</hi> by <hi>Hagar,</hi> a Bond-woman, the other <hi>Iſaac</hi> by <hi>Sarah</hi> a Free-woman.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Bond-woman and her Son, had the Precedence, in time of Conception and Birth, to the Free-woman and her Son.</p>

               <p>That theſe things were diſpoſed of God with <hi>a typical Reſpect</hi> to Goſpel-times, the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, and thus applys them:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hagar</hi> was a Type of <hi>mount Sinai,</hi> and the Legal Covenant there eſtabliſhed; and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was a Type of the <hi>carnal Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as under
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64928:95"/> that Covenant: <hi>Sarah</hi> was a Type of the <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> or of the Goſpel-Church founded on the Covenant of Grace; And <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Type of the true Members of that Church, who are <hi>born of the Spirit;</hi> being converted by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, for the fulfilling of the Promiſe of the Father, unto Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator: And, the <hi>Ejection</hi> of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was to foreſhew the <hi>Abrogation</hi> of the <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant, and <hi>diſſolving</hi> of the Jewiſh Church-ſtate; that ſo the Inheritance of ſpiritual Bleſſings might be clearly devolved upon the Children of God by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There are many other things worthy to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which it is not my preſent Work to inſiſt upon; this general View which hath been taken of the Context being ſufficient to prepare our way to the following Obſervations.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Firſt, The Apoſtle who in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8, &amp; 17. calleth the Promiſe recorded in <hi>Gen. 12. the Goſpel preached to Abraham;</hi> and <hi>the Covenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of God in Chriſt:</hi> doth here expreſly call that Covenant-Tranſaction unto which Circumciſion belonged, and wherein the Right and Priviledg of the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſtated, <hi>the Law;</hi> and their deſire of being under it he condemns, as proceeding from their Folly and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Notwithſtanding all the Priviledges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, they remained in a ſtate of Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64928:95"/> under the Law: And their being Parties in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, and in the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and Children of the earthly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (or Members of that Church whoſe State was founded on the Covenants before mentioned) and ſo intereſted in all the Worſhip there to be performed, (all this I ſay) could no more give them Intereſt in, and Right to, the ſpiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from him, could either inright himſelf or his Seed, in the Covenant of Peculiarity made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the outward Bleſſings thereof: For altho' the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Iſaac</hi> were under the Diſpenſation of thoſe Bleſſings that were the ſhadow, and Type of the good things of the Goſpel; yet their <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and proper Claim in the Intereſt of their Covenant; did fall as far ſhort of Goſpel-bleſſings, as <hi>Iſhamel</hi>'s did of their Priviledges; For as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was, <hi>in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Sence,</hi> born after the Fleſh and the Son of a Bond-woman, ſo were they <hi>myſtically;</hi> and as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did perſecute <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo they (being puft up with a vain Confidence in their carnal Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and Prerogative) did not only reject the Goſpel themſelves, but alſo <hi>perſecuted</hi> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the New <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> And therefore as he was caſt out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from any part in the Inheritance of the Son of Promiſe, ſo muſt they be excluded from the Kingdom of God, and the Inheritance of the Bleſſings thereof.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:64928:96"/>
               <p>Thus did God, in the very beginning of the Covenant-ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, in this <hi>Type</hi> ſet before their Eyes <hi>the Imperfection-thereof,</hi> and the ſad End they would bring themſelves to, by a reſting in it, and overweening of it.</p>

               <p>The Phraſeology of the Old Teſtament will hardly be underſtood in divers Places, without due regard to many of thoſe things that we have been treating of: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That during the time of the Law, the true Church was impaled within the Bounds of the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which in its <hi>intire Body</hi> was a <hi>typical</hi> Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Children of God after the Spirit (tho' as Children under Age, they were ſubject to the Paedagogy of the Law, yet) as to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal State, did walk before God, and found Acceptance with him, upon Terms of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the whole Oeconomy this People were under, did in its typical reſpect, ſubſerve the Ends of the Covenant of Grace to the Elect, who were the true and ſpiritual Worſhippers of God; And
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64928:97"/> the greateſt, and only viſible Number of them, was to be preſerved among that People, until the Goſpel Church-ſtate ſhould take place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But yet, this ſpiritual Relation to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Terms of the New-Covenant which the truly Godly then had, was not ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held forth under the Old Teſtament as it is in the times of the New, and by the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel: But the things relating thereto, were very much wrapt up in dark Shadows, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Many times the things, and People typified, are ſpoken of in prophetical Scriptures, under the names of thoſe Things, and that People, which were the Types of them; And the Promiſe of the choiceſt Goſpel-bleſſings, and moſt glorious State (with reſpect to ſpiritual Glory) of the New-Teſtament Church, are given forth to <hi>Iſrael of old</hi> in thoſe Terms that did <hi>ſuit the preſent State</hi> of things; and are peculiarily directed unto them, and their Seed; but theſe Promiſes being given to them as conſidered in their Relation to God, as his only viſible Church, and Covenant-people, are not to be applyed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, as ſuch, but had their Accompliſhment in the Church when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was rejected, and the Gentiles called to inherit the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham;</hi> Howbeit they being directly given out to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as the only true Church then in being, and a People in whom the Church, which ſhould be, was typified; it was but meet and neceſſary
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64928:98"/> (eſpecially conſidering that the ſpiritual Glory of the Goſpel, and the calling of the Gentiles, was a Myſtery not to be unfolded in thoſe times, but kept under a Veil) that the Terms made uſe of in thoſe Prophecies and Promiſes, ſhould be acommodated unto that <hi>Oeconomy</hi> under which the Church then was; which yet muſt be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in a Sence agreeable to <hi>thoſe times, and that Diſpenſation,</hi> in which they were to have their full Accompliſhment. And therefore ſeeing the Church was then continued in a Line of natural Deſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> being <hi>propagated by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> as long as the Old Covenant ſtate thereof remained unſhaken, the Promiſes made to the Church reſpecting her future Glory, Peace, and Bleſſedneſs in the days of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> are given forth as to <hi>the Seed and Offspring</hi> of the Church then in Being; tho' they did really belong to, and were intended for, (not a carnal Offspring, but) thoſe that God ſhould continue to own as his Covenant-People and Church; even ſuch as ſhould walk in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, the Gentiles, as well as Jews.</p>
               <p>§. 10. All that now remains to be done before I draw to a Period of this Diſcourſe, is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how far <hi>the mutual Reſpect of the Promiſes made to Abraham</hi> may guide us towards a right underſtanding, how <hi>Circumciſion</hi> became unto <hi>Abraham, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. which the Apoſtle affirms it to have bin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64928:98"/> And in opening that Text, the grand Objection againſt that Notion of the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion which I have inſiſted on, will be obviated. In order hereunto, I ſhall firſt ſet down the Text, and give you a brief Expoſition of it; then ſhew you wherein it was verified: and offer ſomething for the ſtrengthening and Eviction of the Sence given.</p>
               <p>The words of the Text are;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouneſs of Faith which he had being yet uncircumciſed; that he might be the Father of all them that believe, tho' they be not circumciſed, that Righteouſneſs may be imputed unto them alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Verſes</hi> foregoing the Apoſtle is diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>of the time</hi> wherein <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for Righteouſneſs, and proves from thence the equal Right of the uncircumciſed Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile (if a Believer) with the circumciſed Jew, in the Bleſſings of the Goſpel, by means, of a ſpiritual Relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> inaſmuch as <hi>his Faith was reckoned to him for Righteouſneſs, not in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion;</hi>

               <p>—<hi>Of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had, yet being uncircumciſed;</hi> that is, of his being Righteous before God thro' believing; which Faith he had, and which Righteouſneſs was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him (the Relative may agree with either Antecedent) while he was uncircumciſed: There are ſome Words ſupplyed by the Tranſlators to fill up the ſence in our Engliſh Phraſe, which the learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> in his <hi>Hor.

               <p>—<hi>That he might be the Father of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion:</hi> the ſence is, that he might be manifeſted to be (things are in Scripture of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſaid <hi>to be,</hi> when they are by any ſolemn Act <hi>declared,</hi> or <hi>confirmed)</hi> the Father of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles, tho' they be not circumciſed; inaſmuch as they alſo are a part of that ſpiritual

               <p>—<hi>That Righteouſneſs might be imputed to them alſo:</hi> take it as before, that it might be <hi>made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and confirmed,</hi> that Righteouſneſs is, and ſhall be imputed to thm alſo: See <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Having given this brief Explication of the Terms uſed in the Text, the next thing to be enqurired is; wherein are the Contents of it verified? or how, or in what reſpect, was Circumciſion a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which <hi>Abraham</hi> had being yet uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed?</p>
               <p>For anſwer to this Enquiry; obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the Prologue to this Covenant of Circumciſion <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. God did expreſly renew, and confirm to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the great Promiſe of the Covenant of Grace, concerning the juſtifying of the Gentiles by Faith in Chriſt, which Bleſſing they ſhould receive in the Relation of Children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo he ſhould become the Father of many Nations; And the Covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being added to former Tranſactions wherein God had confirmed his Covenant in Chriſt with <hi>Abraham;</hi> the uſe of Circumciſion (as to him) was not limited to that <hi>Covenant of Peculiarity</hi> unto which it did immediately belong, but muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily reach farther, and include a Confirmation of all <hi>preceding Tranſactions,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Promiſes</hi> given in them;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64928:100"/> eſpecially of that which was repeated, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the Inſtitution thereof. The Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> (tho' of a different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) did not interfere one with another; but the latter ſtill implyed a Confirmation and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the former; This Covenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not ſupplant, but confirm the Truth of the Goſpel before preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was not added to diſannul the Promiſe, but to ſerve the Ends thereof; and therefore Circumciſion did not only ſeal to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Promiſes of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Bleſſings now given, but alſo was a <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had being yet uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of all that believe in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It was ſo (tho' more indirectly) on this account alſo:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith (as we have ſeen before) was much concerned in the Promiſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Birth, and the <hi>ſeparating</hi> of his Seed from other Nations for the bringing forth of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and he knew well that the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was made with him in purſuance of the great Promiſes before given; and ſo the Seal of this Covenant became unto him, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had before, and confirmed him in his paternal. Relation to Believers in all Nations, which was an Honour before conferred on him. It is the Diſcovery of the <hi>Subſerviency</hi> of Circumciſion, as received by <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the great End and Deſign of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64928:100"/> Covenant of Grace (which was confirmed to <hi>Abraham</hi> before he was circumciſed) that the Apoſtle particularly aims at in this Place; and he proves that the Covenant of Circumciſion is ſo far from excluding the Gentiles from inheriting the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith; as that it was, to him an Aſſurance and Seal of the Promiſe of ſo great a Priviledg to them; as alſo of his own Juſtification thro' Faith, while uncircumciſed.</p>
               <p>And moreover; The Covenant of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not being ſo compleat in it ſelf, as to bring the Church unto that Perfection which in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Counſels of God's Soveraign Grace was intended; and therefore not capable to make any thing perfect by it ſelf; muſt needs be eſtabliſhed as typical, and ſubſervient to the Covenant of Grace, in a temporary Diſpenſation that ſhould uſher in, and then give place to the Goſpel, in the fulneſs of Time; and in reſpect of this Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Covenant now made, the Sign by which it was confirmed, became ultimately and in its typical reſpect, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which <hi>Abraham</hi> had before.</p>
               <p>§. 12. It is no ways difficult to conceive, that Circumciſion might have a different Reſpect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the differing Circumſtances and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of its Subject; Yea that it had ſo, in another Inſtance hath been already proved. It was a Seal of the Inheritance of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and did enſure the Promiſe thereof to them
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64928:101"/> and their Seed; But it gave their Bond-ſervants no ſuch Right or Claim; Even ſo, it was to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had,</hi> &amp;c. but this aroſe from the peculiar, and extraordinary Circumſtances, and Capacity that he was in; for it is not poſſible to conceive that Circumciſion ſhould be <hi>a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had while uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of all that believe in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> to one that never had Faith, either before or after his Circumciſion, nor ever had, or ſhould have, the Relation of a Father to all Believers, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had.</p>
               <p>Now that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Circumciſion here with reſpect to the peculiar Circumſtances, and Capacity of <hi>Abraham</hi> who received it, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the ſcope of his Diſcourſe in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text; in which the Argument that he manageth, is to prove that neither could Circumciſion give to any an Intereſt in that Grace, that juſtifies a Sinner before God, nor the want of it hinder any from obtaining that Intereſt, in the way, and upon the Terms of the Goſpel; ſeeing <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obtained it not by his carnal Prerogative, but was juſtified before he was circumciſed; And the whole ſtreſs of his Argument, lies upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s being a Believer, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Faith, before he received Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Remove this, and his Diſcourſe concludes nothing of what he intends; And hence he infers, that <hi>Abraham</hi> received Circumciſion ſo, as that it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64928:101"/> was to him, <hi>a Seal</hi> (not ſimply, of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith, or of the New-Covenant, but) <hi>of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had being yet uncircumciſed;</hi> as alſo of his <hi>paternal Relation</hi> to all Believers tho' they be not circumciſed; for ſo it follows, <hi>that he might be the Father of all them that believe;</hi> And it is equally abſurd to ſay that Circumciſion was a Seal unto all its Subjects, of the Righteouſneſs of Faith which they had while uncircumciſed, as to affirm that it was the Seal of a paternal Relation to all Believers, unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that received it: Both theſe muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be reſolved into the peculiar Circumſtances of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the particular Relation he had in the Covenants made with him, and the order of their Diſpoſition; and not into the nature of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion conſidered ſimply, and in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And moreover it is obſervable, That immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, in the continuance of his Diſcourſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. the Apoſtle refers Circumciſion to the Law, in contradiſtinction from the Goſpel; for when he hath told us that <hi>the circumciſed Jew</hi> could not obtain <hi>the Bleſſing</hi> of a ſpiritual Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Abraham by virtue of his Circumciſion,</hi> unleſs he did walk <hi>in the ſteps of</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Faith, which he had while uncircumciſed,</hi> ver. 12. he aſſigns this as the reaſon of it in the 13th <hi>Verſe; For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he ſhould be the Heir of the World, was not to</hi> Abraham <hi>or to his Seed, thro' the Law, but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> And I cannot ſee how the Concluſion which the Apoſtle makes
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64928:102"/> concerning the Inefficacy of Circumciſion, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by this Reaſon, if Circumciſion immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and in its own Nature had not belonged to the Law; but, <hi>to the Righteouſneſs of Faith, or Covenant of Grace, as an ordinary Seal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; The Interpretation made of this Text is farther ſtrengthened by the conference of other Places in the New-Teſtament, where we find that Circumciſion is ſtiled an <hi>unſupportable Yoke,</hi> Act. 5. 10. and is ſaid to lay Men under <hi>an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to keep the whole Law;</hi> Gal. 5. 3. and the compleat Diſpenſation of Grace in the Goſpel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the New-Covenant, is conſtantly inſiſted on as that which renders it utterly uſeleſs to the Goſpel-Church, and manifeſts the Inconſiſtency of retaining the Practiſe thereof, with the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their preſent State: See for Inſtance the <hi>Epiſtle to the Galatians,</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 13. the Apoſtle tells them if he did <hi>yet preach Circumciſion, then was the Offence of the Croſs ceaſed;</hi> and he might have lived free from the Perſecutions he now ſuffered from the unbelieving Jews: It was the Apoſtles preaching Chriſt, ſo as therein to aſſert the ſhaking and removing of that Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, unto which Circumciſion did belong, and by which the Jews held the Right of their peculiar Priviledges (tho' now in Truth, the Continuance of thoſe could no longer have been a real Priviledg to them) that was the ground of the Controverſie betwixt them, and of their

                  </gap>igeth its Subjects to Goſpel-Obedience; And therefore is rather, in this reſpect oppoſed to, than ſubſtituted in the place of Circumciſion: And certainly it is more ſafe to interpret <hi>one Text</hi> according to the <hi>general Current</hi> of Scripture, and in a full <hi>Harmony</hi> therewith, than to force ſuch a ſence <hi>upon many Texts,</hi> which in no wiſe they will admit, to bring them into a Compliance with <hi>that Notion of one</hi> which our minds are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt</hi> with; And it is plain that the Notion I have inſiſted on, fully agrees with other places where Circumciſion is diſcourſed of according to its immediate and direct Uſe in the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64928:103"/> For there can be no Contradiction in aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a different, and ſeemingly oppoſite, Uſe and End, to the ſame thing, if it be done in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reſpect: What Circumciſion was <hi>directly and in its immediate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> is one thing; and what it was <hi>as ſubordinate to a better Covenant, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> that had Precedency to it, is another; And it is eaſie to conceive, that it might be that <hi>to the Father of the faithful, in its extraordinary Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that it could not be <hi>to the Children of the Fleſh,</hi> or carnal Seed, <hi>in its ordinary <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, if Circumciſion and Baptiſm have the ſame Uſe, and are Seals of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I can hardly imagine how the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both to the ſame Subjects ſhould at any time be proper; and yet we find thoſe that were circumciſed in their Infancy, were alſo baptized upon the Profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, and that, <hi>before Circumciſion was abrogated;</hi> yea according to the Opinion that hath been argued againſt, The Jews that believed before Chriſt had ſuffered, were at the ſame time under a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand both of circumciſing and baptizing their Infant-ſeed. But if the Principles that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe is built upon, be well proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as I take them to be, there muſt be allowed a vaſt Diſparity, betwixt Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: <hi>The Old Covenant, is not the New,</hi> nor that which is <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> the ſame with that which <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains;</hi> and till <hi>theſe become one, Baptiſm and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion</hi> will never be found <hi>ſo far one,</hi> as that the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64928:103"/> 
                  <hi>Law</hi> for applying <hi>this,</hi> ſhould be <hi>a ſufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> for the Adminiſtration of <hi>that,</hi> unto Infants.</p>
               <p>We have now paſt through the Covenant-Tranſactions of God with <hi>Abraham;</hi> after which we find no ſignal Alteration in the ſtate of the Church, by any New Tranſactions, until the Law was given upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall here put a Period to my preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it being intended only, of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants that God made with Men before the Law.</p>
